If you completed one of the above previously in ICS3U, you are to pick a _different_ topic for this course.

### Task 2 (Complete Research)
Based on your choice of emerging technology, complete research to determine the following:
* What the emerging technology is.
* The impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on societies and cultures around the world. Include any unintentional effects.
* The impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on the local and world economy. Include any unintentional effects.
* The negative impacts of the emerging technology on the natural environment (i.e. plants, animals, water, etc.), and strategies to reduce those negative impacts.
* The negative impacts of the emerging technology on human health (i.e. mental, physical, etc.), and strategies to reduce those negative impacts.

**Your sources _must_ include at least two "industry publications".** These include academic journals, defended thesis papers, peer-review articles, etc.

### Task 3 (Create a Product)
Upon completing research, you will want to collate your data into a **1-2 page (or equivalent) written format**.  We are looking for concise answers. As such, full sentences are _not_ necessary for this particular project.  You can use visuals to assist your explanations. Example products you could create include: a report with imagery, a website, slideshow, a video, or an infographic.

### Task 4 (Citations)
* Cite your work using APA, MLA, or Chicago format (whichever one you prefer).  
* Cite all images used (hyperlinks are sufficient for this part only).
* Your citations can be on a separate webpage, page, or at the end of the video.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

Your teacher will review your work and _might_ present you with follow-up questions based on the content that you submitted.  Be prepared to answer any questions related to your topic, and ensure understanding of all acronyms you use in your work.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS4U.jpg) for this include _Digital Sage_.  
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to analyze the impact of emerging technologies on society, the economy, the environment, and assessing strategies to promote environmental stewardship &#x1F4D7;
