## Task(s)

This is a multi-step assignment, take your time to ensure you complete each step properly.

### Task 1 (Theoretical Computer Science)
Choose a theoretical computer science topic from the list below:
  * Algorithmic Coding Theory
  * Attribute Grammar
  * Computability Theory
  * Computational Geometry
  * Concurrency Theory
  * Distributed Computation
  * Graph Sparsification
  * Lattices and Basis Reduction
  * Stochastic Reasoning with Action Probabilistic Logic
  * Symbolic Computation
  * Type Theory

### Task 2 (Complete Research)
Complete research to determine the following:
* What the theoretical computer science topic is and how it works.
* What ethical issues can propagate from either the _development_ or _implementation_ of the theoretical topic (this could be a difficult question as the topics are slightly abstract in nature).
* In your opinion, what strategies would you propose to encourage ethical practices related to the issues you came up with in the previous section.
* What impact does your topic have on a collaborative research field (i.e. bioinformatics, climatology, economics, geology, health informatics, linguistics, sociology, etc.).
* Two careers that exist in the collaborative research field that you chose.
* What post-secondary education is required to prepare for **one** career you chose (list school options, admission requirements, etc.).

**Your sources _should_ include at least some "industry publications".** These include academic journals, defended thesis papers, peer-review articles, etc.

### Task 3 (Create a Product)
Upon completing research, you will want to collate your data into a **1-2 page (or equivalent) formal report**. As such, full sentences _are_ necessary for this particular project. _Minimal_ use of visuals can be used to assist your explanations. Example products you could create include: a report with headings or a website.

### Task 4 (Citations)
* Cite your work using APA, MLA, or Chicago format (whichever one you want).  
* Cite all images used (hyperlinks are sufficient for this part only).
* Your citations can be on a separate webpage, page, or at the end of the video.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

Your teacher will review your work and _might_ present you with follow-up questions based on the content that you submitted.  Be prepared to answer any questions related to your topic, and ensure understanding of all acronyms you use in your work.
