## Task(s)

Complete this task **after** you have completed, with your team, the [Team Project Plan](./Project-Planning).

* Choose the programming language that best fits your [Team Project](./Project-Planning). Choose something mainstream that has a lot of tutorials, information, help, and documentation to help you. This language is the one you'll be using for the semester.
* Research the documentation standards for the language you'll be using. For example, if you were to choose [Processing](http://www.processing.org/) or Java as your language, then you would look up [JavaDocs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc#Structure_of_a_Javadoc_comment) as your place to start.  There are also some basic examples [here](https://github.com/johnfraserss/ICS4U/tree/master/examples/documentation).
* Once you have found the documentation standard, create a small program that includes the use of _if statements_, _looping structures_, _functions_, and _arrays/lists_ to show your understanding of documentation standards in the language you chose.  This is your chance to review everything you learned back in Grade 11 (ICS3U) along with the new documentation standards.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Assessment
This is not an assessed task, but is a good place for you to practice some of the basics of the language you are planning to use for the semester.

Assessment of these concepts will occur in a later assignment instead.
