# Task(s)
* Complete further research on how to create recursive functions/methods. There are a few examples of recursive functions [here](https://github.com/johnfraserss/ICS4U/tree/master/examples/recursion). 
* Create recursive functions to solve two out of three problems from below.
* As a separate document, submit responses to the following questions: 
  * What are some common pitfalls of recursion? 
  * What issues did you run into during your development of the below algorithms?


**Problem 1: Double Countdown**

```
Given a non-negative integer n, create a double 
countdown-pattern in the console.

Example:
If you ran doubleCountdown(5) you would also get the following output:

5
4
3
2
1
4
3
2
1
0
```



**Problem 2: Extract Evenly Divisible**

```
Given a array of numbers, and a single number n, return an 
extracted array of unique numbers that are 
evenly divisible by n. Your extracted array should be 
sorted in ascending numerical order.

Examples:
If you ran extractEvenlyDivisible([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], 3) you would get a return value of [3,6,9].
If you ran extractEvenlyDivisible([1,9,3,4,3,6,7,8,9], 3) you would get a return value of [3,6,9].
```

**Problem 3: Mirrordromes**

```
Given a string, calculate the amount of mirrordromes that 
exist within a given string (including single letter mirrors).

A mirrordrome is a word that can be mirrored if cut in half and folded over on itself.

Single letters that are considered mirrors in this program include:
i, l, m, n, o, t, u, v, w, x

Letters that are considered mirrored opposites in this program include:
b <-> d, p <-> q, s <-> z

Examples:
If you ran iterativeCalculate("dob") you would get a return value of 2 ("dob" and "o" are both mirrordromes).
If you ran recursiveCalculate("totally") you would get a return value of 7 ("t", "t", "o", "l", "l", "ll", and "tot" are all mirrordromes)
```
