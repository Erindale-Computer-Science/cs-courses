# Plan

###Purpose
To learn another (non-programming) language

###Audience
Self-targeted learning.

###Timeline
By the end of the 20 time project, I hope to be close to being conversationally fluent in Spanish (May 30th).

I am hoping to be completely conversationally fluent by the end of June, but realistically it would probably be more like the end of August.  This includes my ability to read basic texts.

To include my reading and writing skills, I expect this to be done by August 2018 in that I am fluent enough to carry on daily and topical conversations in both written and spoken mediums.

This is all based on the assumption that I can assign at least 2 hours per day to learning the language, but preferably 3-4 hours.  This is not one setting at a time, but can be broken up over small pieces over the day.

###Resources Required
I plan to use the following resources to help my language learning from scratch:
