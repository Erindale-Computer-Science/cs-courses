|A2.1: Create a modular program that is divided among multiple files (i.e. multiple tabs)  | | | | | |
|A2.2: Use modular design concepts that support reusable code (i.e. encapsulation, functions, etc.)  | | | | | |
|A4.1: Work independently, using support documentation to resolve syntax issues during software development  | | | | | |
|A4.3: Create fully documented (and well-named) program code according to industry standards (**javadocs**, block comments, line comments, variable names, etc.)  | | | | | |
|C1.2: Demonstrate the ability to apply data encapsulation in program design (i.e. full encapsulation)  | | | | | |
