Task(s)
-------
Create a basic program that contains the following functions and uses them in a basic visual

```java
addition(float, float) //returns a float
subtract(float, float) //returns a float
multiply(float, float) //returns a float
divide(float, float) //returns a float
maximum(float, float) //returns the larger of the two values as a float
mininum(float, float) //returns the smallest of the two values as a float
reverseArray(float []) //returns a reversed float [ ] array (can use ArrayLists if you prefer), program the algorithm yourself - do not use a built in "reverse()" function 
findInArray(float, float []) //returns the _position(s)_ of first argument found in the second argument (int [])
```

Below is an example of how the _addition_ function would be written:
```java
/** This function takes in two float values and returns the sum of those two values
 *
 *  @param first   This is the first float of the sum
 *  @param second  This is the second float of the sum
 *  @return        The return value is the sum of first and second as a float value
 */
float addition(float first, float second) {
	return first + second;
}
```

Submission Item(s)
------------------
A basic working program that demonstrates your knowledge of the functions given above (including documentation) - do __not__ submit to the IN folder.  The teacher will come around to mark your program starting on the due date.

**Note: There is an example file called Circle.pde (check up top) you can check for more standard commenting/documentation practices**
Due Date(s)
-------------
Will start marking after September 21st

Marking Scheme
-----------
1 mark per function (0.5 documentation, 0.5 if it works properly)
