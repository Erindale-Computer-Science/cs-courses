## Task(s)

Choose an emerging technology from the list below and create a report in any style, using any method of delivery (excluding a word processing document), that focuses on:
* The impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on societies and cultures around the world
* The impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on the local and world economy
* The impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on the environment, and how you would suggest lowering the negative impacts
* The impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on human health, and how you would suggest lowering the negative impacts
* Any ethical issues that could propagate from the development or implementation of this technology
* Propose strategies to encourage ethical practices related to the emerging technology based on the ethical issues you discussed above.

Be prepared to discuss your work and present-to-the-teacher the information that you have found. Be prepared to answer difficult questions and understand all of the acronyms in your presentation.
