## Task(s)

Choose a field that is not _computer science_ or technology related (e.g. literature, forestry, etc.).  Find out how computer science has influenced, and has changed, that particular field.  For example, in the arts, animation has been monumentally changed by computer science. (Cannot use this as a topic).

Once you have researched the topic, complete a report that talks about:
1. How _computer science_ is used within the chosen field.
2. What career opportunities are there within the chosen field?
3. What post-secondary education is required in regards to (2) above?

You can complete this report in any format of your choosing. Be prepared to discuss your work and present-to-the-teacher the information that you have found. Be prepared to answer difficult questions.  Also, understand all of the acronyms in your presentation.
