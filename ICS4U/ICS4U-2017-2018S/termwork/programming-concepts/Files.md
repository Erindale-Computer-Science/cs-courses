## Task(s)
Using the information learned from the  portion of class:

* Update your **UML diagram** to include any _Files_-related information.
* To show your understanding of _Files_, either:
  * Create a small program that is unrelated to your main problem, or
  * Include and create files reading and writing algorithms into your "Main" class within your main problem (i.e. reading text files, binary files, or using an API, etc.)
* Ensure that you create both reading and writing algorithms, unless you are using JavaScript (no output required - output to screen instead).  You will probably want to use the method that you are going to use in your main program.
* Document your new work as required.
