## Task(s)

Using the information learned from the [Updated UML](./UML-Notes) portion of class:

1. Update your **UML diagram** to include any _Inheritance_-related information.
2. To show your understanding of _Inheritance_, either:
  1. Create a small program that is unrelated to your main problem, or
  2. Include and create inherited classes within your main problem
3. Ensure that you create at least one subclass that makes use of the ```super()``` call (or related call in other languages).
4. Document your new classes, functions, and methods.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS4U.jpg) for this include _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to design and write complex algorithms and subprograms
  * We are learning to analyze algorithms for their efficiency

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to apply modular programming concepts_ | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | ------- |
| I can apply data encapsulation in a program design (using classes/objects via inheritance). | |
| I can apply the principle of reusability in program design (through inheritance). | | |
| I can apply data encapsulation in program design (i.e. classes, methods, functions, etc.). | | |
| I can create a modular program that is divided among multiple files. | |

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to use proper code maintenance techniques_ | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | --- |
| I can create fully documented program code according to industry standards. | |
| I can work independently, using support documentation, to resolve syntax issues during software development. | |
