## Task(s)

Complete these tasks using the programming language you have chosen for the semester:
* From [this page](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U/tree/master/assignment/recursion) choose 2 of the recursion options _(excluding Factorial and Fibonacci, as they are the examples)_.
* Complete some research to identify the common pitfalls of recursive functions.  Leave the information in a comment in one of your programs.

This is a **one-off** type task, where it does not have to relate to your overall-semester-program.
