## Task(s)
Using the information learned from the [Searching](http://prezi.com/kpgyneipmt8d/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share) portion of class:

1. Update your **UML diagram** to include any _Searching_-related information.
2. To show your understanding of _Seaching_, either:
  1. Create a small program that is unrelated to your main problem, or
  2. Include and create searching algorithms into your "Main" class within your main problem
3. Ensure that you create both searching algorithms (```linear``` and ```binary``` searches), and then compare their run times to search for an element in the array.  For example, you will want to compare the time of using ```linear``` search in comparison with ```binary``` search + ```.sort()```.  If you need assistance, you can complete a search on the internet to find some starter code.  You will be questioned on the searches themselves, so ensure that you understand everything about them.
4. Document your new work as required.
