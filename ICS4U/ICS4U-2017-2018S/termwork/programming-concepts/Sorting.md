## Task(s)
Using the information learned from the [Sorting](http://prezi.com/_c5eer8nslnm/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share) portion of class:

1. Update your **UML diagram** to include any _Sorting_-related information.
2. To show your understanding of _Sorting_, either:
  1. Create a small program that is unrelated to your main problem, or
  2. Include and create sorting algorithms into your "Main" class within your main problem
3. Ensure that you create at least two sorting algorithms (bubble sort and either insertion or selection sort), and then compare their run times with the built in .sort() function.  For the ```bubble sort``` and the other sort you make, you will want to do the sorting manually (i.e. don't use the built in sort within it).  If you need assistance, you can complete a search on the internet to find some starter code.  You will be questioned on the sorts themselves, so ensure that you understand everything about them.
4. Document your new work as required.
