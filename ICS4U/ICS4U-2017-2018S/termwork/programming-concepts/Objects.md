## Task(s)

Using the information learned from the [UML](./UML-Notes) portion of class:

1. Create a **UML diagram**, **flowchart**, and **design(s)** of your planned program.
2. To show your understanding of Classes/Objects, create a small program (can be unrelated to your main problem).  Within the program you will want to include all Class/Object-related concepts (classes in their own file, anything to do with the object encapsulated within the class, etc.)
3. Ensure that you create at least one method/function that takes in parameters and has one that has a return value.
4. Document your classes, functions, and methods.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS4U.jpg) for this include _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
