## Task(s)

Choose an emerging technology from the list below and create a report in any style, using any method of delivery (excluding a word processing document), that focuses on:
* What the emerging technology is.
* The impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on societies and cultures around the world.
* The impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on the local and world economy.
* The impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on the environment, and how you would suggest lowering the negative impacts.
* The impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on human health, and how you would suggest lowering the negative impacts.
* Any ethical issues that could propagate from the development, implementation or deployment of this technology.
* Propose strategies to encourage ethical practices related to the emerging technology based on the ethical issues you discussed above.

**Your sources _must_ include at least two "industry publications".** These include academic journals, defended thesis papers, peer-review articles, etc.

Be prepared to discuss your work and present-to-the-teacher the information that you have found. Be prepared to answer difficult questions and understand all of the acronyms in your presentation.
