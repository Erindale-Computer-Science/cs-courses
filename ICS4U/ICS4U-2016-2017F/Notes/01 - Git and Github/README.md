#Workflow

After creating a repository, whenever you complete a lot of work on it you
will want to start by _pulling_ the data from GitHub before starting local work.
This ensures that you have the most recent data from the remote repository.

After pulling data, you can _add_ files when you believe you are ready to start
making _commit_ your local changes.  If you find later that you want to change
a file that is on the stage, you can always remove it and add it again later.
Once you have your files on the stage that you want to _commit_ to the repository
(typically when you have any major changes to a common set of file(s)).

If you are working in teams, you will need to start using _branches_ and _pull requests_.
We will cover those at a later time.
