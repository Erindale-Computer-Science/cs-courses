# Alternative Project

_This project is for those that are **not** going on the field trip to Castlebridge_

Contact one of the following teachers, and complete a project based on their specifications.  Each person mustcomplete a different project.
* Mr. Miller - Science (Room 229/231 in the afternoons)
* Ms. McInnis - Media Arts (Room 201 (Arts office during our class))
* Ms. Trottier - Science (Room 228 - AM/lunch availability only)
* Ms. Darroch - Communications Technology (Room 184)
* Ms. McEwen - Computer Technology (Room 181/183)

Each of these teachers has a project that they would like completed as either a teaching tool, or a tool for student use within their classroom.  Your task is to gather information from the teacher in order to understand what they are looking for you to complete.  After obtaining the information from the teacher, your task is to complete the project as described by the teacher.

You will be required to complete a prototype of your project in order to ensure that the project you are completing is what they are actually looking for.  Once the prototype is complete, seek out the teacher and ensure that you are on the right track – making changes as necessary.

Create a user manual (written or in-program), or a video tutorial on how to use your program.

You are to complete the project, upload it to your repository, and put a copy into the _IN_ drive that would be usable by anyone.

Your *Submission Item(s)*, *Due Date(s)*, and *Rubric(s)* are the same as those who went on the field trip to Castlebridge.

*Note: The teachers will be contacted in order to discuss your interactions and completion of the project.*
