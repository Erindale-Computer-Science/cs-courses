Task(s)
-------
1. Gather data from your Grade 1 student group (November 30th)
2. Using the data gathered from your Grade 1 student group, create a visualization or video game that makes use of the sound data received (not just hit play/use as background sounds).  Your programs will be given back to the Grade 1 students to interact with.  This means you will have to consider your target audience when you create your program so that they can understand the work you are doing (i.e. nothing abstract, not too distracting, etc.)
3. Document your work properly.
4. Create a user manual (written or in-program), or a video tutorial on how to use your program.
5. Resources below might prove useful.

Submission Item(s)
------------------
Add this to your programming assignment repository in it's own folder.  
Include a _README.md_ file in the folder to explain what your program does.  
Include a _REFLECTION.md_ file in the folder to talk about the project itself - see rubric for more details.  
**Also**, hand in your work to the IN drive in a format that is usable by anyone that will be sent back to the Grade 1 class.

Due Date(s)
-------------
To be uploaded to the repository by December 16th, 2016  
There will be **no** test for this portion of the course

Rubric(s)

|                                          | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| B1.2: Develop the software product according to the project plan (e.g. ensure that the software meets end user needs, function as intended, etc.) |      |      |      |      |      |
| B1.3: Produce the software according to specifications and create user documentation and training materials |      |      |      |      |      |
| B1.5: Close out the project (i.e. confirm the software meets the user requirements, deliver software in appropriate format, etc.) |      |      |      |      |      |
| B1.6: Review the management of the project (i.e. compare the plan to the actual performance, outline successes, etc. in a reflection) |      |      |      |      |      |
| C1.3: Create separate functions as part of the program design |      |      |      |      |      |
| C1.4: Apply the principles of reusability (i.e. classes, functions, modules, etc.) |      |      |      |      |      |
| A4.3: Create fully documented (and well-named) program code according to industry standards (**javadocs/jsdocs**, block comments, line comments, variable names, etc.) |      |      |      |      |      |

The final mark for this assignment will be calculated as: __Mark = R * C__ where **R = Rubric total** and **C = Completed the task as requested/described (worth 0 or 1)****
