## Task(s)
1. [Sign up for a Wordnik account](https://www.wordnik.com/signup)
2. [Apply for an API key with Wordnik](http://developer.wordnik.com/) (should be done ahead of time, takes a few days to get the key)
3. Using Wordnik, retrieve definitions, related words, and phrases on 10 words of your choice (school appropriate).  Once you retrieve the words, create a visualization on either the individual characters, or on a numeric value (your choice how to calculate)
4. You can use  [loadJSONArray()](https://processing.org/reference/loadJSONArray_.html) from Processing, or [loadJSON()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/loadJSON) from P5.js to read the data received from the API
