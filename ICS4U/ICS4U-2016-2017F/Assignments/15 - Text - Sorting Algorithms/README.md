Task(s)
-------
1. Using the ```rhesus.txt``` file, complete the following two tasks:
  * Read in all of the numbers in the text file, storing them into an array.
  * Read in all of the words in the text file, storing them into a separate array.
2. Once you have stored everything into their own arrays, create the following two sorting algorithms (do not use the built-in ```.sort()```).
  * bubbleSort() for the numbers array
  * insertionSort() for the words array
3. After sorting your arrays, display the information of both arrays in ascending order on the screen in some way.
4. Run the program again, but this time using the ```.sort()``` built-in function.  Take note of the time it takes to complete the sorts, and place your findings in a _ANALYSIS.md_ file.
5. There is a basic example available in the _example_ folder
6. Resources below might prove useful.  
  * [Bubble Sort (C++/Java)](http://cathyatseneca.github.io/DSAnim/web/bubble.html)
  * [Insertion Sort (C++/Java)](http://cathyatseneca.github.io/DSAnim/web/insertion.html)
  * [Sorting Presentation](https://prezi.com/_c5eer8nslnm/sorting/)

Submission Item(s)
------------------
Add this to your programming assignment repository in it's own folder.

Include a _README.md_ file in the folder to explain what your program does.  
Include a _ANALYSIS.md_ file to compare the length of time it takes for your own algorithms to run in comparison to just using the ```.sort()``` built-in to the language.

Due Date(s)
-----------
To be uploaded to the repository by _November 25th, 2016_  
_**There will be a sorting test on November 28th, 2016 in class to ensure understanding**_

Rubric(s)
---------

| | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|A3.4: Create the bubbleSort and insertionSort functions to sort data in an array  | | | | | |
|C2.3: Compare the efficiency of sorting algorithms using run times and computational complexity analysis  | | | | | |
|A4.3: Create fully documented (and well-named) program code according to industry standards (**javadocs/jsdocs**, block comments, line comments, variable names, etc.)  | | | | | |

The final mark for this assignment will be calculated as: __Mark = R * C__ where **R = Rubric total** and **C = Completed the task as requested/described (worth 0 or 1)**
