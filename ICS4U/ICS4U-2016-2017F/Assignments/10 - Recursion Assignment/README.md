Task(s)
-------
1. Prove you understand recursion in a P5js or Processing environment.  Do **not** use work from:
	1. Grade 11, or
	2. Last semester's class, or
	3. [Generating a fractal tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jjeOYMjmDU).
2. To prove your understanding, create a program that displays an animated visual that is themed as one of the following: **_Earth_**, **_Air_**, **_Fire_**, or **_Water_**. (do not use the same theme as a previous assignment).
3. Document your work properly.
4. Resources below might prove useful.  

  * [Recursion in Processing (Nature of Code)](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-8-fractals/)
  * [Recursion in Processing (Fractals) (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3Facu6ZVeA)
  * [Objects in p5js - Example (Circles)](https://p5js.org/examples/examples/Structure_Recursion.php)
  * [Objects in p5js - Example (Fractal Tree) (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jjeOYMjmDU)
  


Submission Item(s)
------------------
Add this to your programming assignment repository in it's own folder.

Include a _README.md_ file in the folder to explain what your program does.

Due Date(s)
-------------
To be uploaded to the repository by ~~October 27th, 2016~~ October 31st, 2016 (added 2 school days due to lost days)

_**There will be a recursion test on ~~October 28th~~ November 1st, 2016 in class to ensure understanding**_

Rubric(s)
---------
This rubric is out of a total of 12

| | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|A3.6: Design a simple and efficient recursive algorithm  | | | | | |
|A4.1: Work independently, using support documentation to resolve syntax issues during software development  | | | | | |
|A4.3: Create fully documented (and well-named) program code according to industry standards (**javadocs/jsdocs**, block comments, line comments, variable names, etc.)  | | | | | |

The final mark for this assignment will be calculated as: __Mark = R * C__ where **R = Rubric total** and **C = Completed the task as requested/described (worth 0 or 1)**
