Task(s)
-------
1. Attach a webcam to your computer.
2. Using the ```pixels[]``` array, store the data locally in an array of your own.
3. Sort your data using a sort that is ```n*log(n)``` in speed, sort the data (examples include: quick sort, merge sort, etc.)
4. Using the sorted data, create a program that uses a binary search algorithm to find a pixel of a particular colour.
5. Using the **unsorted** data, create a program that uses a linear search algorithm to find something on the screen, and then
have the information change on the screen.  As an example, you could find all the red pixels and change them to black,
all green pixels and change them to white, and all blue pixels, and change them to a mid-gray value.
5. Answer the following questions in an _ANALYSIS.md_ file:
  * Compare the length of time it would take for the linear search to find something (on a worst-case basis) and how long the binary search would take on a typical basis.
  * What situations would you use ```sort()``` + ```binarySearch()``` rather than just using ```linearSearch()```? What about vice versa?
6. Resources below might prove useful.

| A1.5: Use the pixels array to read colour information |      |      |      |      |      |
| A3.2: Create a binary and linear search function to find data in the pixels array |      |      |      |      |      |
| C2.2: Compare linear and binary searches |      |      |      |      |      |
| A4.3: Create fully documented (and well-named) program code according to industry standards (**javadocs/jsdocs**, block comments, line comments, variable names, etc.) |      |      |      |      |      |

The final mark for this assignment will be calculated as: __Mark = R * C__ where **R = Rubric total** and **C = Completed the task as requested/described (worth 0 or 1)**
