## Task(s)

1. Complete one of the following options, ensuring the program meets the rubric.  
2. Complete a reflection of the task near the end of the project.


### Option 1 (Big Data)
Complete [this task](https://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/ics4u-culminating-assignment-2016-2017-1fe7a3d114ec488ba5fd9a23c9d3725f) using the data [found here](http://bit.ly/seidel-bigdata).  You data choices are limited to the following options:

* Algae, 
* Cerambycidae,
* Geoname Project, 
* Kepler, 
* NASDAQ, 
* NYPD Crash Data, 
* NYSE, 
* Open Flights, 
* Seattle 911 Calls, 
* Seattle 911 Incidents, 
* Storm Data, 
* UWN, or 
* YAGO2

### Option 2 (Sound Analysis)
Using the [Free Music Archive](http://freemusicarchive.org/), download a whole album of songs (album must have at least 8 songs).  

Create a program that will analyze the album full of songs to find a pattern among the songs.  

Once you find a pattern, visualize the pattern.


### Option 3 (Image Analysis)
Using the [Pexels Images](https://www.pexels.com/) website, choose at least 25 photos.  Choose images that are either of the same genre, or from the same creator.  

Create a program that will analyze all of the images to find a pattern among the images.  

Once you find a pattern, visualize the pattern.


### Option 4 (Video Analysis)
Using the [Pexels Videos](https://videos.pexels.com/) website, choose multiple videos (at least 5 videos) adding up to at least 10 minutes.  Choose videos that are either of the same genre, or from the same creator.  

Create a program that will analyze all of the videos to find a pattern among the videos.  

Once you find a pattern, visualize the pattern.


### Option 5 (Solve a Problem)
Solve a problem that can be solved by creating a program.  Your program must be approved by the teacher **before** you start coding. 


### Option 6 (Create an app)
Create an app that can be released to the Google Play or Apple Store.  You don't have to actually release it to either store, but it should be set up and ready to be released to the store.


### Option 7 (Create a 2D game)
Create a 2D game that does not resemble the one created in Grade 11.


### Option 8 (Cellular Automata)
Using the concept of [Cellular Automata](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-7-cellular-automata/) (and [L-systems](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-8-fractals/#86-l-systems) if you need), create a proof-of-concept game-level generator to generate a 3D terrain for a video game.  

Your program should allow the user to save levels and generate new ones (could be based on input?). 


### Option 9 (Artificial Intelligence in Gaming)
Create a 2D proof-of-concept type of game where you have a single hero-type controlled by the character (mouse or keyboard) and you have multiple enemies.  

The multiple enemy types must have different behaviours to demonstrate.  For example, enemies can 'attack' other enemies, or seek shelter, or seek food, or have a moral system, etc.


### Option 10 (Algorithmic Botany)
Using the [Algorithmic Botary](http://algorithmicbotany.org/) website, which is part of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Calgary, choose a paper/publication (excluding those already chosen and delivered by Daniel Shiffman such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWoJgHFYWxY)).  

Once you have chosen a paper/publication, create a program that shows the work of the paper/publication in action. 


### Option 11 (APIs)
Find and use an API to retrieve a large amount of data to create a visualization program.


### Option 12 (Choose Your Own Topic)
Pick your own topic that will satisfy the rubric.  The topic **must** be cleared by the teacher **before** you begin work.  The difficulty of the project must match a Grade 12 level.


## Reflection Questions
1. Compare your initial plan to your actual performance
2. Outline your successes
3. Discuss what difficulties and challenges you incurred.
4. Make recommendations for how you could improve your work

## Submission Item(s)
Create a **new** repository for your culminating project, and place your work into this repo.   
* Include a _PLAN.md_ file in your folder where you place your original plan.  
* Include a _README.md_ file in the folder to explain what your program does.  
* Include a _REFLECTION.md_ file in the folder answering the reflection questions.

## Due Date(s)
* Your _PLAN.md_ file must by uploaded to the new repository before the winter break.  
* Your program, _README.md_, and _REFLECTION.md_ must be uploaded to the repository by _January 23rd, 2017 by 5pm_
