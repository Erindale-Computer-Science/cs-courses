## Task(s)

Complete this task **after** you have completed, with your team, the [Team Project Plan](./Project-Planning).

At this point you, and your team, are going to have to choose a programming language to use for the remainder of the semester.  It is highly suggested that you choose a language that is mainstream, has a lot of tutorials, information, help, documentation to help you, and aligns with what your team is planning for the [Team Project Plan](./Project-Planning).  Do **not** pick an obscure language, as you will find the semester frustrating (based on previous students' experience).

* Upon choosing the language you plan to use for the semester, research the documentation standards for that particular language. For example, if you were to choose [Processing](http://www.processing.org/) or Java as your language, then you would look up [JavaDocs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc#Structure_of_a_Javadoc_comment) as your place to start.  There are also some basic examples [here](https://github.com/johnfraserss/ICS4U/tree/master/examples/documentation).
* Once you have found the documentation standard, create a small program that includes the use of _if statements_, _looping structures_, _functions_, and _arrays/lists_ to show your understanding of documentation standards in the language you chose.  This is your chance to review everything you learned back in Grade 11 (ICS3U) along with the new documentation standards.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Assessment
This is not an assessed task, but is a good place for you to practice some of the basics of the language you are planning to use for the semester.

Assessment of these concepts will occur in the _Data Structures_ assignment instead.
