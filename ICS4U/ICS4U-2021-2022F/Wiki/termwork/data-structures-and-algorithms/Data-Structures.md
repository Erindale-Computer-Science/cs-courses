## Task(s)

This is a multi-step assignment, take your time to ensure you are completing each step properly.

### Task 1 (Research)

Using any mainstream language of your choice, it is your task to: 

* Research and learn more about: 
  * Classes and objects (not the _struct_ datatype for anyone doing C++) ([examples](https://github.com/johnfraserss/ICS4U/tree/master/examples/objects), [2020 Q1 - Lesson Video](https://youtu.be/EGY_421hTYE))
  * [UML Diagrams](./UML-Notes) ([2020 Q1 - Lesson Video](https://youtu.be/8sxuzHZ5C3E))
  * Extending objects (includes: abstract classes, interfaces, and inheritance) ([notes](https://github.com/johnfraserss/ICS4U/wiki/Extending-Objects-Notes), [examples](https://github.com/johnfraserss/ICS4U/tree/master/examples/extending-objects), [2020 Q1 - Lesson Video](https://youtu.be/8sxuzHZ5C3E))
  * Files (reading and writing) ([examples](https://github.com/johnfraserss/ICS4U/tree/master/examples/files), [2020 Q1 - Lesson Video](https://youtu.be/Uz4Xtj_56Kg))
  
### Task 2 (Diagramming)

After researching the data structures above, you are to create **one of each** detailed [UML diagrams](./UML-Notes).

### Task 3 (Coding)

Create a small program that demonstrates **_your_** understanding of the materials researched.  Your program must have, at least, the following:

* Objects
* At least _**one of**_:
  * Abstract classes
  * Interfaces
  * Inheritance
* Files, by including:
  * Reading and writing of a text file, **or**
  * Reading and writing of a binary file, **or**
  * Reading from an API and writing to a text file, **or**
  * Reading/writing JSON information, **or**
  * Reading from and writing to a database (e.g. SQL, MongoDB, etc.)
* Conversion of datatypes (```int to string```, ```string to int```,  ```float to int```, etc.)
  * This is most easily completed when you are reading/writing files
* Formal documentation (for classes, methods, and functions). 

### Task 4 (Walk-through)
Create a product that walks someone through your program.  In the walk-through, describe:
* The UML diagram and how it helped you plan your program,
* How objects work,
* How you used objects in your program,
* Why were objects needed to complete your task,
* How you used your extending objects concept (abstract, interface, or inheritance)
* Why this concept was needed for your program,
* What you used file reading/writing for,
* How this task was made _easier_ by using file reading/writing,
* Where you used datatype conversion in a meaningful way.

### Things to Consider

Each of the above items must have a purpose for being in your program (not just to meet success criteria).  You'll want to take time to consider how you might include everything.  If you are getting **help** (not copy/paste/plagiarism) from outside sources, ensure that you cite those sources in your code in a comment in the main file.

**Important**: Do not overcomplicate your program, as you will need the time to create the walk-through.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

In the Google Classroom assignment submit the following:  
* UML diagram,
* Code, and 
* Walk-through product.

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS4U.jpg) for this include _Data Structures and Algorithms_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * _We are learning to use proper code maintenance techniques_. &#x1F4D9;
  * _We are learning to design and apply modular programming concepts including complex data types._ &#x1F4D9;&#x1F4D9;

| Learning Goal | Success Criteria  | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| &#x1F4D9;    | I can work independently, using support documentation, to resolve syntax issues during software development. | |
| &#x1F4D9;    | I can create fully documented program code according to industry standards. | |
| &#x1F4D9;&#x1F4D9; | I can decompose a problem into modules, classes, or abstract data types using an object-oriented design methodology (using classes, methods, etc. using UML, etc.).  | |
| &#x1F4D9;&#x1F4D9; | I can apply the principle of reusability in program design (i.e. in modules, methods, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.).  | |
| &#x1F4D9;&#x1F4D9; | I can convert between different types of variables (i.e. string-to-integer, integer-to-character, etc.) | |
| &#x1F4D9;&#x1F4D9; | I can read from, and write to, an external file (i.e. database, API, text file, binary file, etc.). | |
