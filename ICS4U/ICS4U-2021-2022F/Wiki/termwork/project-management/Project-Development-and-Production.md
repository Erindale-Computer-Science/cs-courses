## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS4U.jpg) for this include _Programming and Project Management_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:

  * _We are learning to manage the software development process effectively through all of its stages_. &#x1F4D8;
  * _We are learning to apply standard project management techniques to a student-managed team project._ &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;

| Learning Goal | Success Criteria  | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can develop the software product according to the original project plan (i.e. ensuring the software meets end user needs, functions as intended, and can be produced within quality standards, budget, and timelines). | |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can produce the software according to the specifications (i.e. code, test, and prepare for deployment) and create user documentation and training materials. | |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can use shared resources to manage source code effectively and securely (e.g. organize software components using shared files and folder with timestamps, and proper version control) | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can contribute, as a team member, to the planning, development, production, and close out of a large software project. | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can meet project goals and deadlines by managing individual time during a group project. | |
