# Task(s)

This is a culminating project worth 10% out of the 30% final.  

You will need access to your submissions for the [Emerging Technology (ET)][ET] and [Theoretical Computer Science (TCS)][TCS] projects to complete this culminating activity. 

## Analyze, Synthesize, Evaluate
Envision a **new** product that combines your [ET] topic and your [TCS] topics. Once you have the product decided upon, complete the following using any medium of your choice (e.g. word-processing document, slideshow, webpage, etc.):

1. Define your product and how it incorporates both your [ET] and [TCS] topics.
2. Enumerate the societal impacts (+ and -) that your product would have.
3. Describe the environmental negative impacts that your product would have after creation, and how those issues can be mitigated.
4. Name and describe one ethical concern that could propagate during the manufacturing process of your product.
5. Specify a solution to the ethical concern noted in the previous question.
6. Detail a **new** career that will exist after the creation of your product.

#### Considerations
* You are provided with one in-class day to complete the task. 
* You are expected to make use of the designated period to start, finish, and submit your work by the end of that period. 

## Goals and Success Criteria

The specific goals for this _Digital Sage_ culminating task include:
* Analyze the impact of an emerging technology on society, the environment, and assessing strategies to promote environmental stewardship &#x1F4D7;
* Investigate and report on a theoretical computer science topic, career opportunities therein, as well as analyzing ethical issues related to the theoretical computer science topic &#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7;
