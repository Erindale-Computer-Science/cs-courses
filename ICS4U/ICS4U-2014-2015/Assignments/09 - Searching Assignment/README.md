Task(s)
-------
You **may** work in pairs for this assignment.

1. Modify your Sorting Assignment, create a binary search algorithm that goes through your sorted pixels to find a particular item (your choice).  Once that item is found, create an ellipse that will highlight the location of the item you were searching for.  Have it display differently so that it can be identified on the screen in some way.
2. On mousePressed, have the binary search find another item in the sorted array (do not use random numbers, nor have it look for the exact pixel you click on).
3. In a block comment in your main file, compare the efficiency of linear vs binary searches.

This rubric is out of a total of 12

| | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|C2.2: Compare the efficiency of linear and binary searches using run times and computational complexity analysis  | | | | | |
|A4.1: Work independently, using support documentation to resolve syntax issues during software development  | | | | | |
|A4.3: Create fully documented (and well-named) program code according to industry standards (**javadocs**, block comments, line comments, variable names, etc.)  | | | | | |

The final mark for this assignment will be calculated as: __Mark = R * C__ where **R = Rubric total** and **C = Completed the task as requested/described (worth 0 or 1)**
