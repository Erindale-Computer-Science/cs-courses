Task(s)
-------
Create a basic program that contains the following functions and uses them in a basic visual

```java
add(float, float) //returns a float
subtract(float, float) //returns a float
multiply(float, float) //returns a float
divide(float, float) //returns a float
maximum(float, float) //returns the larger of the two values as a float
mininum(float, float) //returns the smallest of the two values as a float
reverse(float []) //returns a reversed float [ ] array (can use ArrayLists if you prefer)
findInArray(float, float []) //returns the _position(s)_ of first argument found in the second argument (int [])
```

Below is an example of how the _add_ function would be written:
```java
/** This function takes in two float values and returns the sum of those two values
 *
 *  @param first   This is the first float of the sum
 *  @param second  This is the second float of the sum
 *  @return        The return value is the sum of first and second as a float value
 */
float add(float first, float second) {
	return first + second;
}
```

Submission Item(s)
------------------
A basic working program that demonstrates your knowledge of the functions given above (including documentation)

Due Date(s)
