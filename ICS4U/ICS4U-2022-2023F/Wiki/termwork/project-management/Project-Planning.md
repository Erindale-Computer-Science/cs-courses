# Task(s)

_This task assumes your teacher is Mr. Seidel and that there is a collaboration available with the art department. See your teacher for any changes to this project._

For the majority of the semester, you will be working on one large computer programming project as a student-managed team.  

### Task 1 (Form a team)

It is up to you to create your team to work with. Teams should be 2-3 people (no more, no less). Team members **must** be from the same class. Once you have your team, fill in the Google Form connected to the assignment in Google Classroom. Only one team member needs to fill out this form.

### Task 2 (Brainstorming)

It is the job of your team to come up with one of the following:

1. Create a program to help solve a specific portion of a social justice issue, or, an oppression or marginalization issue (i.e. anti-Black racism, Islamophobia, classism, colonization, sexism, etc.), **or**
2. Create an online program that visualizes a simulation of a natural phenomenon (i.e. physics, chemical, wind, water, sound, etc.), **or**
3. Create an online 2D video game that must include a menu, multiple levels, a high score system, and incorporate assets provided by another class for the art.

#### Other criteria/notes
* All projects must be approved by the teacher before beginning. 
* There **must** be a programming component to the project.
  * There is no set programming language for this course, so choose the language appropriate to the project.
* If you chose #1:
  * The scope of the project **must** be larger than simply bringing awareness to a topic (e.g. users should be able to take action), and
  * If you are building a website, you **must** use a programming language (not just HTML/CSS).
* If you chose #2:
  * The scope of the project must be from a ground-up build-it-yourself style of simulation, and
  * Must not use any libraries to help you with the simulation portion.
* If you chose #3, for the art portion you will be working with students from another class who will create these assets for you. The limitations of the game will revolve around the limitations the art team has placed upon us which includes:
  * A maximum of two (2) characters will be developed for your game, and
  * The viewpoint of the characters will be from the front (not isometric, top-down, etc.), and
  * The visualization style will be pixelated, and
  * If you require an environmental background, you can either have the environment (a) scrolling in a single direction, or (b) a large static image (you can always programmatically choose to show only certain portions of the image), and
  * Other smaller assets may be possibly negotiated depending on the time available to the art team.
  * Spring 2023: The art team is unavailable for this project this semester. 

### Task 3 (Planning)

Once you have received approval to move forward, you are required to complete the following:

* Complete a _Software Scope_ document.  There is a template provided for you [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wq86D2gFIRjUwkxP27lqzhPloi0xTtl9vShnPwGxJVI/copy). The link is to a Google Document that should offer you to copy it.  If not, copy the information and create your own. You will need to log in with your school account to see it.
* Complete the _Work Breakdown Structure_ (WBS). There is a template available for this [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QeKToCQhIROeRDBoqTZyl9Oi10wu_0IiahNAXL8OFfs/copy). Remember that the WBS has a very high-level understanding at the top (level 1) and breaks down tasks into smaller chunks as it gets lower (level 2, 3, 4, ...).
* Complete the _Software Quality Assurance Plan_ document. There is a template available for this [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_aqxo0kjvoD2D-9sVxQsDl518PAOB6737dKv4nJtK_Y/copy).
* Create a calendar or use another long-term organization tool to plan out a variety of work and when it will be completed. This is best done after completing the above documentation, as there will be dates you can use from there to inform the information you place in the calendar.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Each **team** will submit the following:
* One _Software Scope Document_, **and**
* One _Work Breakdown Structure_, **and**
* One _Software Quality Assurance Plan_, **and**
* A link to (or screenshot of) your planning board/calendar/etc.

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS4U.jpg) for this include _Project Management_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:

  * _We are learning to manage the software development process effectively through all of its stages._ &#x1F4D8;
  * _We are learning to contribute and reflect on standard project management techniques for a student-managed team project._ &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;

| Learning Goal | Success Criteria  | Reevaluation Opportunity |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can create a software project plan by producing a software scope document and determining tasks, quality standards, deliverables, and schedule. | None. |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can use an appropriate project management tool to manage project components (i.e. charts, calendar, etc.) | None. |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can contribute, as a team member, to the planning, development, production, and close out of a large software project. | None. |
