# Task(s)

It's time to close out your project that you had [planned][program-plan] for previously.  

### Task 1 (Reflect and Review)
At this point, the project will be over. You are to look back on the project and answer the following questions:
1. Does your software meet all user requirements? If not, what would you need to do to get it there?
2. Is your software able to (or could) be delivered to the customer in its current state?  If not, what would you need to do to get it there?
3. How will/would you support your project going forward?
4. Describe how you contributed during the planning, development, and production phases of the project.  Honesty is key here.
5. Do you believe that you completed a fair and equitable portion of the project?  If not, in your opinion, what should have been different to ensure an equitable distribution of work? (Looking for equity, not equality here - see [this][eq-v-eq] image or [this][eq-v-eq-2] image if you do not know the difference).
6. What were your roadblocks/challenges? How did you move through these roadblocks/challenges?
7. Are you proud of your work?  Explain your answer.
8. What's the one thing about yourself above all others you would like to work to improve?
9. For new students coming into this course, what advice would you give them regarding this particular project?
10. Did you meet your own expectations of the letter you wrote in the _Pre-Course Work_?
