## Task(s)

1. Solve the problem you decided upon at the beginning of the semester.
2. Ensure that you include all of the concepts learned throughout the course (excluding recursion) in a _**meaningful and effective**_ way.  Forcing a concept into the program will not count as using the concept meaningfully or efficiently. See rubric below for a reminder of the concepts learning throughout the course.
