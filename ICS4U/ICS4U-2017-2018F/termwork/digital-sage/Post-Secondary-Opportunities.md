## Task
1. Investigate two careers in the _Computer Science_ field to find out what a typical day looks like for them, and find out what schooling they completed in order to work their job.  One job to investigate should be considered local (within Ontario), and another would be an international job (either national or international).
2. Find out the Essential Skills required (as per the Ontario Skills Passport) for the two careers.

Once you have all of the information, create a word processing document to organize your findings, including evaluating your own work habits against the Essential Skills found for the two careers.
