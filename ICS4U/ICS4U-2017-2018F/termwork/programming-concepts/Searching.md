## Task(s)

Your coding project should, at this point, be able to read in data from some source (either a text file, or an API).

Your coding project should also be able to sort data as per the [Sorting](./Sorting) assignment.

Create a function to search through your data (before sorting) using a _linear search_, and have the information display to the screen in some way.

Create another function to search through your data (after sorting) using a _binary search_, and have the information display to the screen in some way.

Complete a complexity analysis of the two different searches (linear vs. binary) and discuss which would be a faster choice in which scenario.

Once you have completed the tasks above, comment out the one search that you do not plan to use, but keep the code in your program.

Be prepared to speak about the difference in time, and have empirical data to back up your statements.
