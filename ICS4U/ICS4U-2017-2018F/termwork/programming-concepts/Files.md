## Task(s)

1. Using the language you chose for the course, you are going to continue making your way towards your final goal.
2. Create a file to read in information from (if you are using APIs in your final project, this is still good practice).  I would suggest creating a file that is similar to a "settings.txt" or a "config.txt" type file where it will help you with setting up your program.
3. Once you have the file created, use file I/O set up for your language to show your understanding of how to read in the file(s) and use the configuration information in the file.
4. You should be able to update the settings from within your program, and when you hit "Save Settings" (or something similar), it should update the text file for you without you having to go directly into the text file to change things.

Your teacher will be changing your "settings/config.txt" file for your program to ensure that you are actually reading from the file and using it to set things up/configure some of the information in your program.

There are examples of [how to read in information from a file](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U/tree/master/examples/files).  You will have to complete research on how to write to a file.
