## Task(s)

Your coding project should, at this point, be able to read in data from some source (either a text file, or an API).

Your task at this point is to take in a large amount of data for your program, and sort that data in some way when you go to display it to the user.

Use either a bubble sort, or an insertion sort, to show your understanding of sorting.  Once this is done, comment out the sort you made, and use a built-in one for speed.

Complete a complexity analysis of the two different sorts (the one you made vs. the built-in one) to get an idea of how much faster the built-in one goes in comparison to the one you made yourself.

Be prepared to speak about the difference in time, and have empirical data to back up your statements.
