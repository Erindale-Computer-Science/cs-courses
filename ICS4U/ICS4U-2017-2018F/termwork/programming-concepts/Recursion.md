## Tasks

From [this page](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U-Code/tree/master/Recursion/src/recursionpkg) choose 2 of the recursion options _(excluding Factorial, Fibonacci, Main (not really an option), and RecursiveInterface (also, not really an option))_.

Complete this task using the programming language you have chosen for the semester.

This is a **one-off** type task, where it does not have to relate to your overall-semester-program.
