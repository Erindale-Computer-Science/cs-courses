## Task(s)

1. Using the language that you chose, it is your task to research and learn about objects.

2. Once you have completed research about it, create a small program that demonstrates your understanding of _objects_.  Include your knowledge of _documentation_ as well.

If you need some help with the format of objects, you can find some examples [here](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U/tree/master/examples/objects).
