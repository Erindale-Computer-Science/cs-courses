## Task(s)

1. Upon choosing the language you plan to use for the year, research the documentation standards for that particular language. For example, if you were to choose [Processing](http://www.processing.org/) as your language, then you would look up [JavaDocs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc#Structure_of_a_Javadoc_comment) as your place to start.

2. Once you have found the documentation standard, create a small program that includes the use of _if statements_, _looping structures_ and _functions_ to show your understanding of documentation standards in the language you chose.
