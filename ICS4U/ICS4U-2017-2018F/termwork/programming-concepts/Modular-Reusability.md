## Task(s)

1. Using the language you chose for the course, you are going to start making your way towards your final goal.
2. You should be using objects whenever you are creating your project.  As such, you should be focusing on creating objects and functions that are reusable.
	* For example, we should be able to take one of your class files and copy/paste it into a new project to create another program using that class file.

Your teacher will be taking one of the class files from your program and creating another project from it.  Ensure that your program is following the principle of modularity.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS4U.jpg) for this include _Programming Concepts_.  
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to apply modular programming concepts

| Success Criteria  | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | ------- |
| I can apply data encapsulation in program design (i.e. classes and functions). | |
| I can decompose a problem into modules, classes, or abstract data types using an object-oriented design methodology. | |
| I can apply the principle of reusability in program design. | |
| I can create a modular program that is divided among multiple files. | |
