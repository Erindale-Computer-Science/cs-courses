## Task(s)

Using the language that you chose to use for the year, it is your task to: 
* Research and learn more about classes and objects (not the _struct_ datatype for anyone doing C++).
* Once you have completed research about it, start implementing objects and classes into your [Main Program](./Main-Program).
* Include documentation for your classes and any methods/functions you create.
* Create an initial **[high-level flowchart](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS3U/wiki/Flowcharting-Notes)**, **design** (some example screenshots) and an initial **[UML class diagram](./UML-Notes)** for how you think the program you are building will be set up.  This is just an initial plan, things can (and probably will) change as the semester goes on.

If you need some help with the format of objects, you can find some examples [here](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U/tree/master/examples/objects).

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS4U.jpg) for this include _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to use complex data types and apply modular programming concepts.
  * We are learning to use proper code maintenance techniques.

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to use complex data types and apply modular programming concepts_ | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | ------- |
| I can decompose a problem into modules, classes, or abstract data types using an object-oriented design methodology (using classes, methods, etc.) | |
| I can apply data encapsulation in a program design (using classes, methods, etc. in flowcharts, UML, etc.). | |
| I can apply the principle of reusability in program design (i.e. flowchart, UML, use case diagrams, etc.) | |
| I can create a modular program that is divided among multiple files. | |

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to use proper code maintenance techniques_ | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | --- |
| I can create fully documented program code according to industry standards. | |
| I can work independently, using support documentation, to resolve syntax issues during software development. | |
