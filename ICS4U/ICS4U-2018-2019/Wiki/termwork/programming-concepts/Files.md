## Task(s)

You are going to continue implementing concepts into your [Main Program](./Main-Program).  It is your task to:
* Research and learn more about reading from and writing to files.  There are some examples [here](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U/tree/master/examples/files) to get you started.
* You are required to incorporate the use of file reading and writing into your [Main Program](./Main-Program) (i.e. reading text files, binary files, using an API, etc.).
  * Ensure you create **both reading and writing** algorithms.
* Document your new classes, functions, and methods.
* Update your **[flowchart](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS3U/wiki/Flowcharting-Notes)** and **[UML class diagram](./UML-Notes)** to include any _Files_-related information.
* Create an **[initial UML use case diagram](./UML-Notes)** for your [Main Program](./Main-Program).

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS4U.jpg) for this include _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to use complex data types and apply modular programming concepts
  * We are learning to design and write complex algorithms and subprograms

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to use complex data types and apply modular programming concepts_ | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | ------- |
| I can apply data encapsulation in a program design (using classes, methods, etc. and including inheritance/interfaces/abstraction as well as file reading/writing in flowcharts, UML, etc.). | |
| I can apply the principle of reusability in program design (i.e. flowchart, UML, use case diagrams, etc.) | |

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to design and write complex algorithms and subprograms_  | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | ------- |
| I can read from, and write to, an external file (i.e. database, API, text file, binary file, etc.) | |
