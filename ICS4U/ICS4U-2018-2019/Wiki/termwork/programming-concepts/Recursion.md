## Task(s)

Complete these one-off tasks using the programming language you have chosen for the semester (these are **unrelated to the main program**):

### Task 1 (Programming)
Create an iterative **and** a recursive function to solve:
* ```Problem 1``` and,
* **Either** ```Problem 2``` or ```Problem 2b``` below:

#### Problem 1: Sum Digits
```
Given a non-negative integer n, return the sum of its digits.

Examples:
If you ran iterativeCalculate(126) you would get a return value of 9.
If you ran recursiveCalculate(126) you would also get a return value of 9.
```

#### Problem 2: Count the Palindromes
```
Given a string, calculate the amount of palindromes that exist within 
that string (single letters excluded).  For example, the work "kayak"
would contain two palindromes within it ("kayak" and "aya").

A palindrome is something that can be spelled the same way forwards as 
backwards.  For example, the word "kayak" spelled backwards is still "kayak".  
Your program should not be case sensitive.  For example, "kayak", "kayAk", 
and "KAYak" would all be considered palindromes.

Examples:
If you ran iterativeCalculate("kayak") you would get a return value of 2 ("kayak" and "aya" are both palindromes).
If you ran recursiveCalculate("kayak") you would also get a return value of 2 ("kayak" and "aya" are both palindromes).
```

#### Problem 2b: Mirrordromes (Complete this **instead** of Problem 2 if you want a challenge)
```
Given a string, calculate the amount of mirrordromes that 
exist within a given string (including single letter mirrors).

A mirrordrome is a word that will check to see if a word can 
be mirrored in the horizontal axis when cut in half.

Single letters that are considered mirrors in this program include:
i, l, m, n, o, t, u, v, w, x

Letters that are considered mirrored opposites in this program include:
b <-> d, p <-> q, s <-> z

Examples:
If you ran iterativeCalculate("dob") you would get a return value of 2 ("dob" and "o" are both mirrordromes).
If you ran recursiveCalculate("totally") you would get a return value of 7 ("t", "t", "o", "l", "l", "ll", and "tot" are all mirrordromes)
```


### Task 2 (Research)
Complete some research to identify the common pitfalls of recursive functions.  Leave the information in a comment in your solution.
