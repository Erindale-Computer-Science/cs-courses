## Task(s)

You are going to continue implementing concepts into your [Main Program](./Main-Program).  It is your task to:
* Research and learn more about extending objects.  There are some examples [here](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U/tree/master/examples/extending-objects) to get you started.
* You are required to include **at least one** of the following: _Inheritance_, _Interfaces_, or _Abstract Classes_
* You are also required to include **at least one** array/list that shows your understanding of _Polymorphism_.
* Document your new classes, functions, and methods.
  * Some languages have special inheritance-style documentation (e.g. Java has a ```{@inheritDoc}``` tag available)
* Update your **[flowchart](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS3U/wiki/Flowcharting-Notes)** to be more detailed than [Objects and Classes](./Objects) assignment.
* Update your **[UML class diagram](./UML-Notes)** to include any _Extending Objects_-related information.
  * At this point, you should be able to fill in the instance variable and methods sections of the class diagrams with better detail.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS4U.jpg) for this include _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to use complex data types and apply modular programming concepts
  * We are learning to use proper code maintenance techniques

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to use complex data types and apply modular programming concepts_ | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | ------- |
| I can use one-dimensional arrays of compound data types (i.e. objects, inheritance/interfaces/abstraction, etc.) | | |
| I can decompose a problem into modules, classes, or abstract data types using an object-oriented design methodology (using classes, methods, etc. and including inheritance/interfaces/abstraction) | |
| I can apply data encapsulation in a program design (using classes, methods, etc. and including inheritance/interfaces/abstraction in flowcharts, UML, etc.). | |
| I can apply the principle of reusability in program design (i.e. flowchart, UML, use case diagrams, etc.) | |
| I can create a modular program that is divided among multiple files. | |

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to use proper code maintenance techniques_ | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | --- |
| I can create fully documented program code according to industry standards. | |
| I can work independently, using support documentation, to resolve syntax issues during software development. | |
