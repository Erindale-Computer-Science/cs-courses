## Task(s)

Complete this task after you have started to decide some direction for your [Main Program](./Main-Program).

* Upon choosing the language you plan to use for the year, research the documentation standards for that particular language. For example, if you were to choose [Processing](http://www.processing.org/) as your language, then you would look up [JavaDocs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc#Structure_of_a_Javadoc_comment) as your place to start.  There are also some examples [here](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U/tree/master/examples/objects).
* Once you have found the documentation standard, create a small program that includes the use of _if statements_, _looping structures_, _functions_, and _arrays/lists_ to show your understanding of documentation standards in the language you chose.  This is your chance to review everything you learned back in Grade 11 (ICS3U).
