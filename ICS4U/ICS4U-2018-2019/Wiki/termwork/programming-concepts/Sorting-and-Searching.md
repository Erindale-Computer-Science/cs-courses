## Task(s)

You are going to continue implementing concepts into your [Main Program](./Main-Program).  It is your task to:
* Research and learn more about sorting (O(n^2) algorithms) and searching (linear and binary).  If you need to refer back to them, the [sorting notes](https://prezi.com/_c5eer8nslnm/?token=88ece7eaa67f60ab5460103cce9b5d825cbfc1fbc6078a6e7d24ed005116eb51&utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share) and [searching notes](https://prezi.com/kpgyneipmt8d/?token=ae5e2b5183917c2f7255596164f5d487a9a8a9a55d769fa66405d57c9886e5d5&utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share) are available.
* Complete the _Sorting_, _Searching_, and _General_ tasks below.

### Sorting Task(s):
* Create your own ```bubble sort``` and ```selection sort``` algorithms and implement them into your [Main Program](./Main-Program).
* Read in a large amount of data (50MB or more) related to your program.
* Sort the data and display it in some way.
* Complete a computational complexity analysis of each of your own sorting algorithms and also compare it to the built-in ```.sort()``` function (figure out which one runs faster, why, when, etc.)
* Once this task is complete, comment out your own sorts and use the built-in ```.sort()``` going forward.

### Searching Task(s):
* Create your own ```linear search``` and ```binary search``` algorithms and implement them into your [Main Program](./Main-Program)
* Complete a computational complexity analysis of each of the searching algorithms.  One part of this analysis should include a comparison between using ```linear search``` and using ```binary search``` + ```.sort()```.

### General Task(s):
* Update your **[flowchart](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS3U/wiki/Flowcharting-Notes)**, **[UML class diagram](./UML-Notes)** and **[UML use case diagram](./UML-Notes)** to include any _Sorting/Searching_-related information.
* Document your new work as required.

Be prepared to speak about the computational complexity analyses, and have **empirical data** to back up your statements.
