## Task(s)

Choose a theoretical computer science topic from the list below and create a report in any style, using any method of delivery (excluding a word processing document), that focuses on:

* What the theoretical computer science topic is
* The impacts (+ and -) of the theoretical computer science on societies and cultures around the world.
* The impacts (+ and -) of the theoretical computer science on the local and world economy.
* Any ethical issues that could propagate from the development or implementation of this technology.
* Propose strategies to encourage ethical practices related to the theoretical computer science topic based on the ethical issues you discussed above.
* Research and describe careers associated with computer studies and the chosen theoretical computer science research field.
* Research and describe post-secondary education required to prepare for a career in this particular theoretical computer science research field.

**Your sources _must_ include at least two "industry publication".** These include academic journals, defended thesis papers, peer-review articles, etc.

Be prepared to discuss your work and present-to-the-teacher the information that you have found. Be prepared to answer difficult questions and understand all of the acronyms in your presentation.

Choose one of the following theoretical computer science topics (no more than 3 people per topic):
  * Graph theory
  * Computability Theory
  * Complexity Theory
  * Attribute Grammar
  * Automata Theory
  * Data Mining
  * Computer Vision
  * Computational Number Theory
  * Computational Geometry
  * Symbolic Computation
  * Machine Learning
  * Concurrency Theory
  * Lattices and Basis Reduction
