## Task(s)

This culminating activity is worth **10%** of the **30%** final mark.

* Solve the problem you decided upon at the beginning of the semester for your [Main Program](./Main-Program).
* In a _**meaningful and effective**_ way, ensure that you include all of the concepts learned throughout the course:
  * [Documentation](./Documentation)
  * [Objects](./Objects)
  * [Extending Objects](./Extending-Objects)
  * [Sorting & Searching](./Sorting-and-Searching)
  * [Files](./Files)
  * You are **_not expected_** to implement [Recursion](./Recursion) into your [Main Program](./Main-Program)
  * _**Forcing a concept into the program will not count as using the concept meaningfully or effectively.**_

See success criteria below for a reminder of the concepts learning throughout the course, and what you will be evaluated on.

## What to Hand in?
* All of your programming files for this project, and
* An updated finalized flowchart, and
* An updated finalized UML class diagram, and
* An updated finalized UML use case diagram.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

## Goals and Success Criteria

The specific goal(s) for this [_Programming Concepts_](./images/ICS4U.jpg) culminating task include:
  * Use complex data types and apply modular programming concepts.
  * Design and write complex algorithms and subprograms.
  * Use proper code maintenance techniques.

| Success Criteria for <br/> _Use complex data types and apply modular programming concepts_  | Comments |
| ----------- | ------- |
| I can use one-dimensional arrays of compound data types (i.e. objects, structures, etc.) | |
| I can decompose a problem into modules, classes, or abstract data types using an object-oriented design methodology. | |
| I can apply the principle of reusability in program design. | |
| I can apply data encapsulation in program design (i.e. classes, methods, functions, etc.). | |
| I can create a modular program that is efficiently divided among multiple files. | |

| Success Criteria for <br/> _Design and write complex algorithms and subprograms_  | Comments |
| ----------- | ------- |
| I can create a program that reads from, and/or writes to, an external file (i.e. database, API, text file, binary file, etc.). | |
| I can create and use an efficient sorting algorithm. | |
| I can create and use an efficient searching algorithm. | |

| Success Criteria for <br/> _Use proper code maintenance techniques._  | Comments |
| ----------- | ------- |
| I can work independently, using support documentation, to resolve syntax issues during software development. | |
| I can create fully documented program code according to industry standards. | |
| **_I can ensure that the program works according to the plan(s) set out at the beginning of the project._** | |
