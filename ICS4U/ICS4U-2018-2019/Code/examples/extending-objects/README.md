# Extending Objects (Short Notes)

There are multiple ways to save time and force cohesion between different programmers: _Inheritance, Interfaces,_ and _Abstract Classes_.  Using these difference extensions, we can then use _Polymorphism_ to our advantage. Short description of each below.


| Type of Extension | Main Benefit | Language Specific Information |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Interfaces** | Create a template of methods | Java, C# and Processing have support for this.  This is a work-around to the multiple-inheritance problem, and helps programmers to conform to a standard.  Python does not support interfaces. |
| **Abstract Classes** | Like interfaces; however, you can create the body of functions and instance variables | Java, C#, Python, and Processing all support abstract classes. |
| **Inheritance** | Full access to parent class | Java, C#, Python, and Processing all have support for this.  Out of the list, only Python allows for multiple-inheritance (usually more difficult to work with) |

# Polymorphism

Is the idea of using a single array/list to hold multiple different related data types.  See the examples in the Polymorphism folder above.
