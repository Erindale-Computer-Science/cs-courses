Task(s)
-------
You **may** work in pairs for this assignment.

1. You will need at least 20MB free on your G drive to complete this assignment
2. Download the new set of code from the Github repository [related to Searching](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U-Code/tree/master/Searching/src/searchingpkg).
3. You are to create a new Java Package called _Sorting_.
4. Copy and paste the code from the repository into your **own package**.
5. Copy your work over from the [Sorting assignment](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U/tree/master/Assignments/10%20-%20Sorting) into your new _Searching_ Java Package.
6. **Careful**: When copying code over for new code that is in _MainFile.java_, ensure you only copy the sorting algorithms themselves.
7. Fill in the blanks in the **MainFile.java** in the searching package.
