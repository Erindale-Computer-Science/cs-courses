Task(s)
-------
You **may** work in pairs for this assignment.

Using Eclipse and Java:

1. Download the code templates from [here](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U-Code/tree/master/Recursion/src/recursionpkg).
2. You are to create a new Java Package called *Recursion*.
3. Copy and paste the code from the repository into your own package.
4. Fill in the blanks for the following files:
	* BunnyEars.java
	* Fibonacci.java
	* SumDigits.java
	* Palindrome.java	_completing to here will earn a maximum mark of level 3_
	* MaxPalindromes.java
	* Mirrordromes.java _completing to here will earn a maximum mark of level 4_
	* _Factorial.java is an example file if you need assistance._
 
There are areas that are commented to let you know what sections to fill in.

_**Remember to properly document your code and use proper variable names.  You will also have to update the MainFile.java file to include testing for Palindrome, MaxPalindromes, and Mirrordromes as well**_


Due Date(s) & Submission Item(s)
------------------
Ensure your teacher sees your work after completion. Assumed completion by April 8th, 2016.

_**There will be a recursion test on April 12th, 2016 in class to ensure understanding**_

Rubric(s)
---------
This rubric is out of a total of 12

| | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|A3.6: Design a simple and efficient recursive algorithm  | | | | | |
|A4.1: Work independently, using support documentation to resolve syntax issues during software development  | | | | | |
|A4.3: Create fully documented (and well-named) program code according to industry standards (**javadocs**, block comments, line comments, variable names, etc.)  | | | | | |

The final mark for this assignment will be calculated as: __Mark = R * C__ where **R = Rubric total** and **C = Completed the task as requested/described (worth 0 or 1)**
