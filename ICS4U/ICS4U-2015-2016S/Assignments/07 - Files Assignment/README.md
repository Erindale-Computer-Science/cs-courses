Task(s)
-------
Using your Inheritance/Polymorphism assignment, you are going to:

1. Create a .txt, .csv, or .tsv file in order for you to demonstrate your ability to read from files.  A CSV file is a "comma-separated-values" file, and a TSV file is a "tab-separated-values" file.  This file must include at least 20 objects of different types in it.  Check out [this](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U/blob/master/Assignments/07%20-%20Files%20Assignment/input.txt) file for an example using Circles and Spheres.  Each line of the file (except first and last) is set up as "<class name>:radius:<3D-Position-Information>".
2. Create a program that:
  * Reads in the data from (1) above,
  * Creates objects of the appropriate type with the given information,
  * Stores it into a single array (polymorphism), 
  * Then displays the information in some way.

3. You will also be responsible for completing all documentation and using proper variable names in your program.

4. Resources below might prove useful.  

  * [Example using Scanner](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U/blob/master/Assignments/07%20-%20Files%20Assignment/ScannerReadFile.java)
  * [Example using BufferedReader] (https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U/blob/master/Assignments/07%20-%20Files%20Assignment/BufferedReaderReadFile.java)
  * [File IO in Java - coming soon](#)

Rubric(s)
---------
This rubric is out of a total of 12

| | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|A3.1: Demonstrate the ability to read from an external file from within a computer program  | | | | | |
|A4.1: Work independently, using support documentation to resolve syntax issues during software development  | | | | | |
|A4.3: Create fully documented program code according to industry standards (javadocs, block comments, line comments, etc.)  | | | | | |

The final mark for this assignment will be calculated as: __Mark = R * C__ where **R = Rubric total** and **C = Completed the task as requested/described (worth 0 or 1)**
