**School**: John Fraser Secondary School  
**Department**: Technology  
**Course**: Computer Technology, Grade 10, Open Level  
**Course Fee**: None  
**Prerequisite**: None  
**Course Code**: TEJ2O  
**Credit(s)**: 1.0

## Course Description
This course introduces students to computer systems, networking, and interfacing, as well as electronics and robotics. Students will assemble, repair, and configure computers with various types of operating systems and application software. Students will build small electronic circuits and write computer programs to control simple peripheral devices or robots. Students will also develop an awareness of related environmental and societal issues, and will learn about secondary and postsecondary pathways and career opportunities in computer technology. 

## Overarching Learning Goals

1. **Electronics:** _Students explore computer hardware and use the design process to allow them to design, generate, prototype, and test their own electronic creations._
2. **Data and Logic:** _Students design, plan, and create simple computer programs that interface with hardware to learn how to think logically._
3. **Citizenship:** _Students investigate social, environmental, and ethical issues, as well as people skills to develop life-long, conscientious attitudes and habits._

## Assessment and Evaluations
* Assessment and evaluation will be based on the overarching learning goals, specific learning goals, and success criteria.  All of which are based on the provincial curriculum expectations. All of the assessment and evaluation will be feedback-focused, and will **not** focus as heavily on specific grades. As such, students will be provided with detailed feedback (whether verbal or written), and provided with an approximate level-based assessment.
* Students will be provided with numerous/varied opportunities to demonstrate their achievement of the overarching learning goals.
* Skills such as the ability to work independently, demonstrate teamwork, efficient work/study skills, and initiative will be assessed both as part of the grade and reported separately from the subject grade.

#### Sample Tasks
Students might complete the following sample tasks during the term, in which an equal distribution and weighting will be placed upon the student's demonstration of knowledge, their ability communicate, think, and apply the knowledge:

* Written Reports
* Presentations
* Interviews
* Diagrams
* Schematics
* Assignments
* Quizzes/Tests
* Research and supported opinion pieces
* Electronic debugging/development
* Computer program debugging/development

#### Final evaluation

Based on the work completed during the term, students will complete culminating tasks that allow the students to demonstrate their understanding which is typically a portfolio of their non-programming/electronics work which could include reflection questions (10%), and a culminating task encompassing their programming and electronics knowledge (20%).

## Equipment / Materials

A personal organization system, either physical **or** electronic, would prove useful in this course, to ensure that you are meeting all deadlines.  Course materials will be provided through an online medium; however, you might find it beneficial to take notes on anything in class.

Occasionally additional material(s) will be needed for projects and assignments.


## Tips for Success

To help you complete this course successfully, here are a few tips that you can follow:

1. Keep your notes and assignments current and organized.
2. Complete homework and class work as assigned, by the assigned due date(s).
3. Review notes on a regular basis, not just the night before any assessment/due date.
4. Aim to complete your electronics/programming projects at least a few days before the deadline to ensure you can receive feedback from your peers before the final deadline, and have time to fix any last minute errors that might propogate.

## Deadlines

**Why are deadlines set for assigned work?**

Deadlines are realistic in the normal working life outside of the school setting. Deadlines are also set as a reasonable management strategy for teachers so that workloads can be varied and balanced. We also set deadlines as a way of bringing closure to one unit of work and moving ahead to another.

* It is **your** responsibility to seek assistance from the teacher when you feel unable to complete a task / assignment due to insufficient knowledge or skill. Ensure that you have also sought the assistance of your peers if you have difficulties get answers immediately from your teacher. It is not acceptable to advise the teacher of difficulty the day before / on the day a task / assignment is due.
* It is never acceptable to submit work late without negotiating alternate deadlines.
* Some deadlines are negotiable, some are absolute. All deadlines will be provided for ahead of time. In the case of not submitting / completing work on either a negotiated or absolute deadline you may receive a mark of zero as a placeholder until those success criteria are demonstrated.
* Chronic lateness in submitting tasks / assignments may prevent your teacher from evaluating your work and may require you to demonstrate your knowledge and skills within an alternate setting such as summer school.

## Plagiarism and Discipline

It is **expected** that students will produce **their own original work**. It is also expected that students will require the use of examples to gather a full understanding of the work they are completing. Students **must cite all sources** (including imagery) that they are using to gather their information to complete their work.  

Electronic theft, misrepresentation of original work, cheating, use of unauthorized aids, use of artificial intelligence, and false representation of work will result in appropriate consequences. Consequences will depend on the severity of the situation; however, they can include: assessing the work as a zero on the evaluation until the material has been demonstrated as your own.
