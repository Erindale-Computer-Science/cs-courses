Depending on which component you were given, you will answer different questions in your presentation.

### For **all** presentations, complete the following:

* Provide a diagram and description about the functionality of your piece of hardware.
* Provide the first historical version of the computer component(s)
* During the presentation, ensure you include appropriate terminology and acronyms associated with your part(s).
  * Depending on the item(s) you're presenting, some possible terms include: cache, USB, FSB, IEEE 1394, MHz, GHz, bit, byte, kilobits, kilobytes, megabits, megabytes, analog, digital, flash, etc.
* Define what each term means, assuming your peers know nothing about the technology.
* Citations to any images or work used as reference using the IEEE citation format (in-text and references).

### For anyone who has the numbers 5, 9 - 17, 20, 23, 25, 26, and 27, answer the following additional questions:

* What other component(s) does your particular part connect to?
* How does this component interact with the other ones?
* Describe how to safely handle the item without causing damage to it when installing it.

### For anyone who has the numbers 1, 2, 4, 7, 22, 24, and 28, answer the following additional questions:

* Describe how these components can be damaged during regular use.
* Describe how to identify when these components fail.

### For anyone who has the numbers 3 or 21, answer the following additional question(s):

* Why would someone use this device over a standard consumer desktop/laptop? Include what the use cases are for these devices that a standard consumer desktop/laptop cannot easily deal with.
* Describe how to handle these items safely.

### For anyone who has the numbers 6, 8, 18, and 19, answer the following additional question(s):

* How does your component facilitate connections between multiple devices?
* Describe how to troubleshoot whether your device has failed.
* Why would someone choose your component the other one of similar nature? What benefit(s) does your provide over the other option. You will want to converse with the other person doing the other topic so that you do not repeat yourselves while presenting.
  * If you're doing #6, compare with #8
  * If you're doing #8, compare with #6
  * If you're doing #18, compare with #19
  * If you're doing #19, compare with #18

## Suggested Presentation Order

1, 2, 4, 7, 22, 24, 28, 6, 8, 5, 9 - 20, 23, 25, 26, 27, 3, 21
