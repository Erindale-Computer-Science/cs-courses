# &#x1F4D9; Hardware Components - Assessment and Presentation

## Task 1 (Study Guide)

Create a single-page study-guide that contains a condensed, summarized version of all of the work you completed in [Hardware Components (Presentation)](./Hardware-Components-Presentation). These will be all made available to each student to use, and could possibly be displayed in class.

Using precise terminology, your study guide must include, at minimum:

* The name of the component, and
* An image of your component, and
* The function of the component, and
* If you did a larger component, include visual identifiers to individual components (semiconductors, transistors, capacitors, etc.), and
* The paper size will be 8.5" x 14" (legal)

## Task 2 (Presentation)

Present your study guide to the class.

## Task 3 (In the future...)

You will be assessed on the knowledge presented by **all** students in the class.  All available study guides will be provided to you for the assessment.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates and submission details](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.
