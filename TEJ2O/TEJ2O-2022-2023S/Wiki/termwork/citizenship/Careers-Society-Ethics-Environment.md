# &#x1F4D7; Careers, Society, Ethics, and the Environment

## Task(s)

This project will be slowly completed over the semester. We will focus on one section at a time as the semester goes on. For any of the written work, cite your sources (in-text and reference) using IEEE format.

### Careers

In a written format, complete the following tasks relating to careers.

* Find multiple computer technology careers for each of the post-secondary pathways below:
  * Directly out of high school,
  * Apprenticeship,
  * College diploma,
  * University degree.
* Choose one career from each pathway above and create a visual representation of the differences/similarities for:
  * Starting salary,
  * Average salary, 
  * High-end salary,
  * Years of training required to become proficient in the job,
  * Costs associated with schooling/training,
* Assuming everyone retires from their career 30 years after leaving high school, compare the total income generated over that time frame. Remember to subtract any schooling/training costs from any of the careers that require it.
* Which of the career paths above would you recommend? Why?
* For the previous question, what biases and assumptions are included in your recommendation?

### Society

Un-submit your document and update it to include what occurs in the day-to-day lives of those working in the four specific careers you chose above. Use full sentences where appropriate, respond to the following prompts:

* Talk about what a typical day in the lives of people working in those careers look like today. 
* Choose three different day-to-day tasks for each of the careers (do not repeat the same task for different careers), then describe how these tasks would be completed differently without computers.

### Ethics

Un-submit your document and update it with an Ethics section for each of the careers you spoke about in the _Society_ section above. While referring to [this website](https://engineerscanada.ca/publications/public-guideline-on-the-code-of-ethics#notice), use full sentences where appropriate and respond to the following prompts:

* Choose four **different** tenets from ["The code of ethics"](https://engineerscanada.ca/publications/public-guideline-on-the-code-of-ethics#-the-code-of-ethics) section on the website provided. If you need an expanded explanation of each tenet, they are provided in the ["Interpretation of the code of ethics"](https://engineerscanada.ca/publications/public-guideline-on-the-code-of-ethics#-interpretation-of-the-code-of-ethics) portion of the website. Choose **one** tenet to speak about **per** career, based on the following prompts. Each career will use a different tenet for discussion.
  * Describe a situation that would break this tenet of the code of ethics in this particular career, 
  * Describe possible consequences that could occur based on the above situation,
  * Describe why people might decide *not* to follow this particular tenet of the code of ethics in this career,
  * Describe why this particular tenet is important for this particular career. You can use the situation and consequences previously mentioned, if that helps with your explanation.

### Environment

Complete research to identify:  

* What **actually** happens with computer parts (including phones, etc.) when they are disposed of (not recycled)?
* What occurs when computer parts break down?
* What happens to the surrounding ground area?
* What happens to the surrounding water sources?
* How might the above affect non-human wildlife (both flora and fauna)?
* How might the above affect air quality?
* How might the above affect humans?
* What countries are most affected by this?
* If disposed of in Canada, how might the above disproportionately affect rural and Indigenous communities?

After completing your research, create visual representation of your information (similar to an infographic) which includes **all** of the above information in some way. This visual representation has a word limit of five (5) words. A title and your name (if included) do not count towards this word limit.

Once you are done your infographic, create a document that includes answer to the following prompts:
* Explain how your infographic works (what items mean, etc.).
* Explain what can be done about these issues (other than the basics of reduce, reuse, and recycle).
* Explain what you envision the world to be like in 100 years if no action is taken now.

Submit both your infographic and the document.
