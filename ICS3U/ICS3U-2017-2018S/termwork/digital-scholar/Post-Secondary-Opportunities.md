## Task(s)

Contact at least **two** people in the _Computer Science_ field to find out:
  * What does a typical day looks like for them?
  * How do they believe their field of work impacts the environment (i.e. e-waste generation, lowering usage of resources, etc.)? (see rubric for more guidance in how to direct this question)
  * What schooling did they complete in order to do their job?

One person should be considered local (within Ontario), and another would be an international contact (either national or international).

Once you have all of the information, organize your findings in a method/medium you prefer (word document, mind map, OneNote document, Google Keep, etc.).  Include proof of contact, and proof that the person is actually someone in the correct field.

Examples of proof of contact include:
  * A screenshot of your discussion with the person (if done electronically)
  * If you spoke to a person over the phone or in person, you can include a screenshot of your phone, or list a date/time/number that you contacted and who you spoke with.
