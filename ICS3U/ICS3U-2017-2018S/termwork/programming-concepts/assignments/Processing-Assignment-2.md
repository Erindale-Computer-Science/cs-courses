## Task(s)
You are to complete this task on your own, (i.e. no group submissions, no plagiarizing from each other (or internet), etc.)  

* Using your knowledge of custom functions, arrays, String manipulation, and file input _create a program that satisfies the task criteria, learning goals and success criteria below_. 
* Create a _**design (aka screenshots) and flowchart**_ for your program **before** starting on the code.  This must be shown to the teacher **prior to coding**.

## Task Criteria
Your program **does not** have:
  * Flashing colours in it
  * Similarity to exercises

Your program will contain:
  * An amalgamation of all of the exercises from [Exercise - Set A](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS3U/wiki/Processing-Exercise-Set-A) and [Exercise - Set B](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS3U/wiki/Processing-Exercise-Set-B) (**excluding Exercise 8**) into a multi-screen program (i.e. 1 screen per exercise).  Your program will end up having 11 different screens based on the 11 different exercises.
  * A login/password type system with multiple "users".  
    * **As an example**, each user can be given different privileges on which screens they have available to them.  You could have ```User A``` only be able to see the exercises from ```Set A```.  ```User B``` only be able to see the exercises from ```Set B```.  Finally, ```Super User``` can see all exercises in the program).
  * An "encrypted" password that you store into a plain text file (and read from when someone is "logging in" to the program).  
    * An example of basic encryption is the [Caesar cipher](https://learncryptography.com/classical-encryption/caesar-cipher).
  * At least one function that uses parameters and return values within the program.
    * **As an example**, you could create a function to complete the login/password checking ```boolean login(String user, String password) { ... }``` that compares the input from the user to the "database" that you have in a text file).

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goals](./images/ICS3U.jpg) for this include **both** _Programming Concepts_, and _Computational Analysis and Design_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to design and analyze algorithms for software solutions (CAD). 
  * We are learning to design and organize a computer program (PC).
  * We are learning to create simple computer programs (PC).
