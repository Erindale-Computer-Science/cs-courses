## Task(s)
You are to complete this task on your own (i.e. no group submissions, or no plagiarizing from each other (or internet), etc.)  

1. Using your knowledge of variables, documentation, if statements, and loops _create a program that satisfies the task criteria, learning goals and success criteria below_.  
2. Create a _**design and flowchart**_ for your program **before** starting on the code.  This must be shown to the teacher prior to coding.


## Task Criteria
Your program **does not** have:
  1. Flashing colours in it
  2. Similarity to exercises or the exemplar

Your program **does** have:
  1. A "multi-screen" program (can click between them, or use the keyboard to swap between them)
  2. On one "screen", solve a math-based problem (not a game, cannot "_solve boredom_")
  3. A non-Math-class problem to solve (not a game, cannot "_solve boredom_")
  4. Your program fits to a maximum ```size(600, 600)```

See exemplar in the OUT drive before approaching teacher with questions.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goals](./images/ICS3U.jpg) for this include **both** _Programming Concepts_, and _Computational Analysis and Design_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to design and analyze algorithms for software solutions (CAD). 
  * We are learning to design and organize a computer program (PC).
  * We are learning to create simple computer programs (PC).
