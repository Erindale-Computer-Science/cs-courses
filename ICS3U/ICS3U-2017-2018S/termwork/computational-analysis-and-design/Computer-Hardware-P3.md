## Task(s)

This is Part 3 of the [Hardware](./Computer-Hardware.md) project.

For this task you are to use the knowledge that you gathered from everyone else to complete the following.

### Computer Build

You are a new-hire for a company and you need to buy the best computer that you can with the funding provided.  You are required to purchase individual computer parts (no laptops, or all-in-one purchases), as well as any specific pieces of technology (as noted in the section following the occupation tables) for your occupation.  To help you with this task, there is an [online site](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/) that can guide you with the main purchases of the computer.  You are to stay **below** the budget given.  The budget given is in Canadian dollars, and you are to take into account shipping (to the school), and assume you must pay HST on all purchases.  If you are shipping something from out of country, you will also have to figure out how to deal with customs and tariffs.
