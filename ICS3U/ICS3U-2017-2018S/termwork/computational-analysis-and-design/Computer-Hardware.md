## Task(s)

This is a multi-part task - see the breakdown below.

### Part 1

Choose one of the computer parts below to complete research on.  You are to complete research on **at least** these questions, but you are expected to come up with your own research elements that you believe would be important:

1. What is the history of this computer part (short version)?
2. Why was this computer part developed?
3. What does this computer part connect to?
4. What is this computer part?
5. What are the costs for the part (budget version, high end version, etc.)

Once you have completed your research, you are to create either an infographic, or a visually-appealing poster, that provides answers to the questions above.

#### Computer Parts

There will be 2-3 people per part below (depends on class size, teacher will inform you).  This will be on a first-come-first-served basis.

* **Processing Units**: Central (CPU) and Graphic (GPU, also include the video/graphics card)
* **Audio Devices**: Audio/Sound card, microphones, speakers
* **Display Devices**: Monitors, projectors, virtual reality displays
* **Daily Input Devices**: Keyboard and mouse
* **Specialty Input Devices**: Scanners and drawing tablets
* **Archival Devices**: Printers and tape storage
* **Storage Devices**: Hard disk drives and solid state drives
* **Other**: Motherboard, Random Access Memory, Network Adapters

### Part 2
There will be a gallery-walk style set of presentations of your infographic/poster.  A portion of the class will be presenting, while the other portion of the class walks around asking questions and finding out information.  Below are the suggested questions that you should be prepared to ask:

1. What does this part connect to?
2. What is the purpose of this part?
3. Who was the inventor of the part?
4. What is the average cost of the part?

#### Presentation Schedules
Presentations will occur on Thursday, February 8th and Monday, February 12th as follows
