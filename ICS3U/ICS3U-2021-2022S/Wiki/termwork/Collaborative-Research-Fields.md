# &#x1F4D7; Collaborative Research Fields

## Task(s)

This is a multi-step assignment, take your time to ensure you are completing them properly.

### Task 1 (Collaborative Research)
Choose another field of studies (arts, geography, social science, etc.) and complete some research to determine how this field of study collaborates with computer science to develop a product or perform duties. After completing the above, you will want to identify what the collaborative research field would be called (some examples include: bioinformatics, climatology, economics, health informatics, linguistics, sociology, etc.). This field **_must_** be related to the [emerging technology](./Emerging-Technologies) that you chose.



### Task 2 (Complete In-depth Research)

Based on your choices in Task 1 above, complete research to determine the following:
* Create a **short** introduction to the collaborative field. Make it clear how the field collaborates with computer science (not assessed).
* Find multiple post-secondary programs that lead to a career in the collaborative field (not into computer science). You can include things like: admission requirements, tuition, why someone would choose that particular school, etc.
* Find trends relating to the career above relating to the outlook of the career.  
	* Find trends locally (Ontario), nationally (Canada), **and** abroad (anywhere but Ontario or Canada). 
	* Examples of trends can include how the career has done in the past (pay, amount of jobs, etc.) and how they are forecast to be in the future. For example: "The current salary of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in Ontario is $XX,XXX per year. The pay has increased by Y% since Z years ago. The future outlook of this job is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."
* Find groups or programs that **support students at a high-school level** that are interested in pursuing this career (hackathons, job shadowing opportunities, camp, conferences, etc.).
* Find environmental groups or community partners that help guide people in this collaborative field in making sustainable and environmentally-conscious decisions/policies in their workplace.  This can be at either a local (Ontario), national (Canada), or international level. For example, as computer science teachers, we belong to multiple groups. One of these groups could have environmental initiatives such as: recommendations on how to keep a computer lab environmentally friendly, etc.
* Identify a piece of software that is used **exclusively** in the collaborative field (i.e. ArcGIS in geology), and describe possible ways that this piece of software can (or could) be used to support environmental protection measures.
	*  Do **not** choose something simple that can be found in any career (word processor, spreadsheet, presentation, etc.). 



### Task 3 (Create a Report)

Upon completing research, collate your data from _Task 2_ into a 1000 word (or less) formal report format. A template has been provided on Google Classroom. Do not use acronyms in your report.



### Task 4 (Citations)

* Cite your work using APA, MLA, or Chicago format (whichever one you want) in the citations section of the template provided.
* Cite all images used.  You can use just hyperlinks for the citing of **images**.
* Your sources, title, and name do not count towards your word-count limit.



## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.



## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS3U.jpg) for this include _Digital Scholar_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
* We are learning to promote environmental stewardship and sustainability &#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7;
* We are learning to investigate post-secondary education and career prospects related to collaborative research fields &#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7;

| Learning Goal | Success Criteria  | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |

| &#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7; | I can identify **environmental groups or community partners** that provide resources and guidance for environmental stewardship within the career chosen at either a municipal, provincial, or national level. | |
| &#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7; | I can identify **groups and programs** that support students at a high-school level that are interested in pursuing the chosen career. | |
| &#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7; | I can research and report on **post-secondary programs** leading to careers in the collaborative field chosen. | |
| &#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7; | I can research and describe **trends in careers** that require computer skills, using local, national and international sources in the collaborative field chosen. | |
