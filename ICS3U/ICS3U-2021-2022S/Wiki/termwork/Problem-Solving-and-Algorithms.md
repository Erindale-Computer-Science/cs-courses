# &#x1F4D9; Problem Solving and Algorithms

## Task(s)
The following tasks are based on reading articles or watching videos and then responding to some questions based on the information provided.  You will want to create a document of some sort to record your responses.

You do **not** have to answer the following in full sentences.  Using point-form and/or tables might help with keeping your responses within the space requirements.



### Task 1 (Problem Solving)

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM9ASKAni_s) and read through the [Problem Solving Notes](./Problem-Solving-Strategies-Notes) and complete the following:
* Use **either** the _Stepwise Refinement_ **or** _Tables and Charts_ problem solving method to figure out how to make a cup of tea.   Keep your response to 100 words or less.  If you choose _Tables and Charts_, you can include visual charts/tables to assist your response and they do not count towards your word-count.



### Task 2 (Machine vs. Source, Interpreter vs. Compiler)

Read through [this article](https://medium.com/@rahul77349/machine-code-vs-byte-code-vs-object-code-vs-source-code-vs-assembly-code-812c9780f24c) on different types of code that the computer uses and [this article](https://www.programiz.com/article/difference-compiler-interpreter) on interpreters versus compilers and then complete the following:
* Describe how source code and machine code are related without using any computer-based terminology.  You might find it useful to use a metaphor, simile, or relatable story in your description. 
* Describe the similarities and differences of interpreters and compilers in the same style as above. 
* Keep your total response for this task to 200 words or less.



### Task 3 (Binary)

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M41M9ATm49M) on the basics of binary and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsxT4FfRBaM) video on how to convert decimal numbers into binary and then complete the following:
* Provide a step-by-step description of how you would convert the first two digits of your student number to binary. For example, if my student number was 123456 then I would convert **12** (the first two digits) into binary.
* Keep your response to 100 words or less.



### Task 4 (Computer Hardware)

We previously learned about the different parts of the computer in the [Computer Hardware](./Computer-Hardware) assignment. Using the knowledge you gathered from that assignment **and** using a career connected to the action verb you used in the [second programming assignment](./Programming-Assignment-2), complete the following:

* Choose **two internal** computer components (those found _inside_ the case) and **one external** component, and explain why they are the most important pieces of technology for career you used. Explain your reasoning.
* If you were purchasing the parts above, describe what you would look for in those parts. You will want to use specific terminology about the parts (i.e. GHZ, cache, etc.). Justify your choices.
* Keep your total response for this task to 300 words or less.



### Task 5 (Citations)

* Cite your work using APA, MLA, or Chicago format (whichever one you want) in the citations section of the template provided.
* Cite all images used.  You can use just hyperlinks for the citing of **images**.
* Your sources, title, and name do not count towards your word-count limits.



## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.



## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goals](./images/ICS3U.jpg) for this include _Computers and Algorithms_.
