## Task(s)

### Hardware Understanding

You will be provided with a specific scenario (see chart below) that could occur within your SDLC program. You are to create a step-by-step list (think 20-30 steps, including the computer components) showing your understanding of how the scenario works from a **computer hardware perspective**.

Your steps **_must_** make clear the purpose of each computer component (and how they communicate with each other) within the context of your scenario.

| Scenario                                                     | Randomly Assigned Student # |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| The user clicks on an item they want to purchase and the request gets sent to the application’s server.<br/><br/>*Mouse - ? - ? - ? - Network Card* | 684000, 761968, 923509, 727645, 693108                            |
| The user’s computer receives a photo of the item they want to purchase from the application’s server, which is then displayed on the monitor.<br/><br/>*Network Card - ? - ? - ? - Monitor* |   956305, 860156, 873589, 928801, 684088                          |
| The user types in their login information, which is then sent to the application’s server.<br/><br/>*Keyboard - ? - ? - ? - Network Card* |  890787, 951032, 844966, 741638, 873452                           |
| The user’s computer receives a shipping label from the application’s server, which is then sent to the printer.<br/><br/>*Network Card - ? - ? - ? - Printer* |  960554, 736971, 958042, 695749                            |
| The user wants to upload a picture of the item they’re selling. How does this work, starting from their hard drive and then being sent to the application’s server?<br/><br/>*Hard Drive - ? - ? - ? - Network Card* |         789002, 678498, 691147, 679258, 682279                    |
| The user clicks on the Save button on a program that is local to the computer.<br/><br/>*Mouse - ? - ? - ? - Solid State Drive* |    945044, 981358, 679299, 696424, 784709                         |
| The user has a basic painting application open and clicks on the screen to draw a rectangle.<br/><br/>*Mouse - ? - ? - ? - Monitor* |    681374, 750455, 871417, 784746                         |

_Hint:_ The CPU and RAM are always included in all scenarios.

Within your step-by-step list, you *must* have a highly detailed breakdown of **one** of the following computer components (in the chart below). Include the specifications in your response.

| Hardware Components                            | Required specifications to include                           |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Central Processing Unit                        | Arithmetic logic unit, Memory management unit, cache, clock rate |
| Hard Disk Drive **or** <br/> Solid State Drive | Reading/writing of data, cache, units of space               |
| Random Access Memory (volatile)                | Reading/writing of data, addressing, speed                   |
| Video/Graphics Card                            | GPU, Video memory, RAMDAC, 1 of the output interfaces (VGA, DVI, HDMI, etc.) |
