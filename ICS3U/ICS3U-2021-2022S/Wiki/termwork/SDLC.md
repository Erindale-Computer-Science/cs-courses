# &#x1F4D9; Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Task(s)

### SDLC Basics

You are to go through the SDLC process to create a computer downloadable program (not a mobile program) similar in function to:  

**Grammarly** alternative and must include at minimum the following:
* Check my grammar and spelling 
* Write stuff down
* Vocabulary enhancement (thesaurus)
* Canadian English language
* Login system
* Saving system
* Cross referencing for plagiarism
* Language fluency testing

Using your knowledge of the SDLC complete the following tasks:
* **Requirement Analysis:** Complete an analysis of what the program would need/require to work properly.  Create a bullet-point list of what you believe would be necessary for this program to work.
* **Design (Part 1):** Create a **high-level** flowchart of the program and how it would work.  You are aiming for approximately 20-30 symbols. This design we are planning is from the **program's perspective**. The program would require input from the user to do certain tasks, process this information and then output information as appropriate.
* **Design (Part 2):** Create a visual design of what your application would look like upon completion.  To do this, you would complete rough sketches (or use a digital painting program) to design what your program would look like. On average, submissions contains 3-6 sketches of different screens.

#### Extra Information

##### Websites and Applications

There are multiple website applications that can help you with developing screenshots and flowcharts.  Remember that **if you sign up for any online tools** that you are to use your <student#>@pdsb.net account, and do **not** use your real name for anything.  **This is for your personal safety and privacy**.
