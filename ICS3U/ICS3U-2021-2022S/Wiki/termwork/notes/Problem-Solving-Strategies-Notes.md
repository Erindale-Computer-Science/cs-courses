# Problem Solving Strategies

Although the most intuitive of problem solving strategies that students tend to use frequently is _trial and error_, there are more than just this one style of solving problems.  Below are a list of different strategies we can use to solve problems.

* [Divide and Conquer](#divide-and-conquer)
* [Stepwise Refinement](#stepwise-refinement)
* [Working Backwards](#working-backwards)
* [Extreme Cases](#extreme-cases)
* [Trial and Error](#trial-and-error)
* [Tables and Charts](#tables-and-charts)

#### Divide and Conquer

You have a large problem that you are not sure how to deal with in one shot.  As such, you break your problem into smaller sub-problems.  If these sub-problems are still too large to solve then you continue this process until the solution becomes clear.

#### Stepwise Refinement

This is a variation on _divide and conquer_ in that you break down a large problem into a few general steps to solve the problem.  Once you have a general idea of what to do, you continue to add details to each step until the solution becomes clear.

#### Working Backwards

You have a solution.  Great.  How do we get there?  This problem solving strategy has you start with the solution and then you start undoing the problem one step at a time.

#### Extreme Cases

As you work through a problem, you will want to consider some _extreme cases_ (or extreme values) of the involved variables.  With using the extremes, you will (hopefully) be able to gain some insight into your problem.

#### Trial and Error

For _trial and error_, you make different attempts at solving the problem until you find a solution.  For each of your attempts, you are (hopefully) learning something each time regarding what _to_ do and what _not to_ do.

#### Tables and Charts

This problem solving method requires that you have a set of data that you can graph (or create a chart).  You take the seeming unrelated written data (for example, paired values of time vs money) and create a chart of the data.  The hope is to glean some information from the visual representation of the data to solve a problem.



## Example

**Problem:** Making a bowl of oatmeal

#### Divide and Conquer

Using a divide and conquer method, we would have to figure out the components of making oatmeal.

Break down into:

* Oats
* Preparation method
* Toppings

You can then break down each section further, we'll break down the _Oats_ section here as an example:

* Steel-cut oats
* Rolled oats
* Quick-cooking oats

You can continue to break down the other sections as well, but this is just an idea to get you started.



#### Stepwise Refinement

This would be a similar setup as _Divide and Conquer_ above, but is listed as a set of steps.  For example, below is _one_ method of preparing oatmeal: a Stovetop Steel-cut oats preparation.

1. Pour 3 cups (750ml) of water into a pot
   1. Ensure the water is cold
   2. Ensure pot is large enough to hold water
2. Add 1 cup (250ml) of oats to pot
   1. Ensure you are using steel-cut oats
   2. Ensure pot is large enough to hold both water and oats
3. ...



#### Working Backwards

When working backwards, you want to ensure that it's clear the steps you provide are not just a reversed order of working forwards. You can do this by adding information next to each of your steps.  Using the same example as in _Stepwise Refinement_ above (Stovetop Steel-cut oats), we can come up with the following:

1. There is a bowl of oatmeal prepared to eat.
2. There are toppings added to the oatmeal, this means I would have found cinnamon and bananas to add.
3. The oatmeal is in a bowl, this means I found a bowl to add the oatmeal to from the stove.
4. There is oatmeal in a pot, this means I have finished the cooking process.
5. ...



#### Extreme Cases

Different variables that could affect an extreme case of oatmeal (assuming the same recipe as above) include: cooking temperature, length of cook, quantity of water, quantity of oats, pot size, size of bowl, topping availability, topping quantity, etc.

* If the stove is not turned on, the oatmeal will take _much_ longer to complete
* If the pot size is too small, the oatmeal will overflow creating a mess and having a lower final quantity (due to waste).
* ...



#### Trial and Error

These are steps that you might take the first time you are trying something, or when you are trying to figure out how to prepare oatmeal.  Some examples could include:

* Using different types of oats, what happens?
* Changing pot sizes for different surface areas.
* ...



#### Tables and Charts

Different variables that could affect the creation of oatmeal (assuming the same recipe as above) include: 

* cooking temperature, length of cook, quantity of water, quantity of oats, pot size, size of bowl, topping availability, topping quantity, etc.

Using the variables above, we can create a set of tables or charts to analyze the final products over time. For example, we can:

* Plot out temperature versus texture of oatmeal, or 
* Plot out subjective taste values versus topping choices, or
* ...
