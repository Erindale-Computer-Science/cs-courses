# &#x1F4D9; SDLC and Flowcharting

## Task(s)

You have been asked to create a computer program based on the following:

_A representative from a local company wants you to create an app for a phone that is similar in function to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)_

Using your knowledge of flowcharting and the SDLC complete the following tasks:
* Create a flowchart of how this system would work (Flowcharting)
* Create a handful of screenshots of what your app would look like.  Include labeling, and name each of the screens so that someone could easily follow along.

For creating flowcharts, there are some tools available online such as:
* [Create.ly](http://creately.com/tour) - you will have to sign up for an account to save work.  Do so **only** using your school's Google account.

You will be required to demonstrate your understanding to the teacher near the due date.  The teacher will come around (or call you up) no earlier than the day that the project is due.

Notes for: [SDLC](./Software-Development-Life-Cycle-Notes) and [Flowcharting](./Flowcharting-Notes).
