## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goals](./images/ICS3U.jpg) for this include **both** _Programming Concepts_, and _Computational Analysis and Design_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to design and analyze algorithms for software solutions &#x1F4D9;&#x1F4D9; 
  * We are learning to design and organize a computer program &#x1F4D8;
  * We are learning to create simple computer programs &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;

| Learning Goal | Success Criteria  | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| &#x1F4D9;&#x1F4D9; | I can design simple algorithms according to user specifications | |
| &#x1F4D9;&#x1F4D9; | I can design algorithms to detect, intercept, and handle exceptions (e.g., division by zero, roots of negatives, etc.) | |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can use workplace and professional conventions correctly to write programs and internal documentation (headers, function documentation, etc.)  | |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can interpret error messages at different times during the software development process (logging, debugging, etc.) | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can write custom subprograms that use parameter passing and appropriate scope to perform specific tasks in a program (functions with parameters) | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can write programs that declare, initialize, modify, and access lists/dictionaries/strings | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can write programs that use nested structures | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can identify and correct syntax, logic, and run-time errors (try, except, raise, etc.) | |
