# &#x1F4D7; Emerging Technology

## Task(s)

Choose an [emerging technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emerging_technologies) (first-come-first-served **teacher-approval required**) and create a report in any style, using any method of delivery (excluding a word processing document), that focuses on:
* What the emerging technology is.
* The impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on society in general.
* The impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on the economy in general.
* The impacts (- only) of the emerging technology on the environment.
* Ways that the emerging technology can be used to support environmental protection measures.
  * For example, if you were a biologist in the middle of a rain forest, how could your emerging technology help save endangered species **(cannot use this example in your presentation)**.
* Careers that require computing skills related to the emerging technology by describing the trends in that career at a local, national, and international level.

Be prepared to discuss your work and present-to-the-teacher the information that you have found.  Be prepared to answer many questions, and ensure understanding of all acronyms you use in your presentation.

#### Citations 
Cite your work using APA, MLA, or Chicago format (whichever one you want).  
Cite all images used.  You can use just hyperlinks for the citing of images.
