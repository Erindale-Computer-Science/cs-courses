# &#x1F4D7; Collaborative Research

## Task(s)

**This is a multi-step project.  Ensure that you go through each step.**

* Find a teacher in **another** department (**not** the Technology department), and
  * Ask where/how computer science is used in their field of study (**not teaching**).
    * You are trying to find a collaborative field that uses _**both**_ computer science **and** their field of study.  
    * For example, if you spoke with a visual arts teacher, they could respond with animation as an example field (cannot use this example for your project).
  * Ask the teacher where you can find more information about the collaborative field.  
    * If they just suggest a search engine, probe them for a different response.  
* After consulting with the teacher above, complete your own research on the collaborative field.
* Upon completing research, create a report in any style, using any method of delivery (excluding a word processing document), that focuses on:
  * What the collaborative research field is
  * The impacts (+ and -) of the collaborative research field on society in general.
  * The impacts (+ and -) of the collaborative research field on the economy in general. 
  * Post-secondary pathways and programs leading to a career in this collaborative field.
  * Using this same career, how can someone in that career helps reduce the impact of computers on the environment.
    * Looking for specific information here, not just general ideas (i.e. _**don't**_ include basic things like: turning off monitors, turning off lights, recycling, etc.)
  * Government agencies and community partners that provide resources/guidance for environmental stewardship within this collaborative field.

Be prepared to discuss your work and present-to-the-teacher the information that you have found.  Be prepared to answer many questions, and ensure understanding of all acronyms you use in your presentation.  

#### Citations

Cite your work using APA, MLA, or Chicago format (whichever one you want).
