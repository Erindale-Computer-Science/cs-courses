## Task(s)

#### Task 1

Find a teacher in another department (not the Technology department), and find out how _computer science_ is used in their field.  For example, if you spoke with a visual arts teacher, they could respond with animation as an example field (cannot be used in your project).

Using the teacher you spoke to as a _first contact_, ask them where they think you can find more information.  If they just suggest a search engine, probe them for a different response.  

#### Task 2

At this point, complete research based on the guidance of the teacher that you spoke with.  Your research should include all of the points in the success criteria below.

#### Task 3
Once you have researched the topic, complete a report in any format of your choosing (excluding a word processing document).

Be prepared to discuss your work and present-to-the-teacher the information that you have found.  Include the teacher you spoke with as a source in your cited sources.
