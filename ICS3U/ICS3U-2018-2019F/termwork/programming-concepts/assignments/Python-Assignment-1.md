## Task(s)
You are to complete this task on your own (i.e. no group submissions, or no plagiarizing from each other (or internet), etc.)  

* Create a _**design and flowchart**_ for your program **before** starting on the code.  This must be shown to the teacher prior to coding.
* Create a program that satisfies the task criteria, learning goals and success criteria below by including the following concepts
  * Documentation Header
  * Variables
  * Operators and Conversion
  * ```input()```
  * ```if``` statements
  * ```while``` or ```for``` loops
  * Functions
  * Formal documentation (aka docstrings)
  * Assertions (you will want to comment these out before handing in).

## Task Criteria
Your program **does not** have:
  1. Similarity to exercises or notes

Your program **does** have:
  1. A menu system that is displayed in the console.
  2. Math-based options
  3. Word-based options
