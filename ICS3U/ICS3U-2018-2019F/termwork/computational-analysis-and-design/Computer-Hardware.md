## Task(s)

### Task 1 (Research and Present)

* Choose one of computer parts below, and in groups of 3-4 create a short 3-8 minute presentation.  Your presentation will include the topics/information below.
* There will only be **one group per part category** on a **first-come-first-served basis**.

#### Computer Parts

* **Central Processing Unit**: Central (CPU)
* **Video-Related Information**: Video/Graphics card and GPU
* **Audio Processing Device**: Audio/Sound card
* **Other Audio Devices**: Microphones, speakers
* **Display Devices**: Monitors, projectors, virtual reality displays
* **Daily Input Devices**: Keyboard and mouse
* **Specialty Input Devices**: Scanners and drawing tablets
* **Archival Devices**: Printers (2D & 3D) and tape storage
* **Storage Devices**: Hard disk drives and solid state drives
* **Other**: Motherboard, Random Access Memory

#### Presentation Information

You are to complete research on **at least** these questions, but you are expected to come up with your own research elements that you believe would be important:

1. What is this computer part?
2. Who invented the part, and what need did it fulfill?
3. What other computer part(s) does your part connect to?
4. What are the costs for the part (budget version, high end version, etc.)
5. What are the pros/cons of purchasing a more expensive version of the part.
6. What number system(s) is/are used by your part (Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal, ASCII, Unicode)
7. Based on #6 above, give a quick/basic description of how the number system(s) works.


### Task 2 (Individual Assessment)

To assess your knowledge of computer hardware, there will be an individualized task for you to complete to show your understanding.  This will be posted near the end of the presentations.

You can find that task [here](./Computer-Hardware-P2).
