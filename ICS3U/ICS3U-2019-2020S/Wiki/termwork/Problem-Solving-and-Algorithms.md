# &#x1F4D9; Problem Solving and Algorithms

## Task(s)
The following tasks are based on reading articles or watching videos and then responding to some questions based on the information provided.  You will want to create a document of some sort to record your responses.

You do **not** have to answer the following in full sentences.  Using point-form or tables might help with keeping your responses within the space requirements.

### Task 1 (Problem Solving)
Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM9ASKAni_s) and read through the [Problem Solving Notes](./Problem-Solving-Strategies-Notes) and complete the following:
* Choose **either** the _Working Backwards_ problem solving method **or** _Tables and Charts_ strategy and describe how you would start with raw ingredients and make a cup of tea.  Keep your response to 100 words or less.  If you choose _Tables and Charts_, you can include visual charts/tables to assist your response and they do not count towards your word-count.

### Task 2 (Machine vs. Source)
Read through [this article](https://medium.com/@rahul77349/machine-code-vs-byte-code-vs-object-code-vs-source-code-vs-assembly-code-812c9780f24c) on different types of code that the computer uses and complete the following:
* Describe how source code and machine code are related without using any computer-based terminology.  You might find it useful to use a metaphor or simile in your description.  Keep your response to 100 words or less.

### Task 3 (Interpreters versus Compilers)
Read through [this article](https://www.programiz.com/article/difference-compiler-interpreter) on interpreters versus compilers and complete the following:
* Describe the similarities and differences of interpreters and compilers that could be understood by someone in Grade 1.  Keep your response to 100 words or less.

### Task 4 (Binary)
Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M41M9ATm49M) on the basics of binary, and then complete the following:
* Describe how a hard drive would physically store information on it (Hint: there aren't actual 1s and 0s physically written onto the hard drive's platters).  Keep your response to 100 words or less.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Submit your document to either the IN drive, Mr. Seidel's email (if you're in his class), or however Mr. Kowalczewski has requested your project. Ensure that your submission follows the submission guidelines as described below.

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goals](./images/ICS3U.jpg) for this include _Projects and Algorithms_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to solve problems related to distinct components of a computer. &#x1F4D9;&#x1F4D9;
