## &#x1F4D7; Task(s)

*This task is set up assuming Mr. Seidel is requesting this. If you have a different teacher, see them about what they want you to do for this particular task.*

My plan is to give every student a Level 4 in this course; however, there are three prerequisites to this: complete the course in-take survey, the letter below, attempt to complete the work in class as best you can, and attempt to become the person you write about in the letter as best you can.

### Survey

Complete the survey provided in-class to help me get to know you as a person now/in-the-past.

### Letter

In a word processing document, write me a letter dated January 25th, 2023 (the last day of the semester). This letter should contain the story of what happened to you between now and then. Pretend like it's the end of the semester and you are looking back, like a future-reflection letter. To guide your writing, you should:
* Write the letter in past tense
  * As you are writing the letter, pretend today is the last day of the course), 
  * Phrases such as "I hope...", "I intend", and "I will" must not appear in this letter 
* Provide as much detail as possible,
* Begin your letter with the words "_\<Teacher name here\>_, I received my level 4 in this course because...",
* Report on all the insights you had acquired and milestones you attained during the semester
  * These could be skills you picked up along the way
* Explain how you achieved your level 4 without talking about the assignments
  * Do not say "I received a level 4 on this assignment and that assignment, so therefore, I deserve a level 4."
* Do not just list what course work you have done.
* I am mainly interested in the person you will have become by the end of the course. 
  * I am interested in the attitude, feelings, and worldview of that person. 
  * Hopefully this person will have done all they wished to do or become everything they wanted to be by the end of this course.

Typical responses in the past have ranged anywhere from 3 paragraphs to 3 pages.
