## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goals](./images/ICS3U.jpg) for this include _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * _We are learning to work with different data structures in simple computer programs._ &#x1F4D8;
  * _We are learning to test and create simple modular programs._ &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;
  * _We are learning to format, analyze, and document computer programs to ensure accuracy and clarity._ &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;

| Learning Goal | Success Criteria  | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| &#x1F4D8;     | I can write programs that declare, initialize, modify, and access one-dimensional arrays. | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;     | I can apply the principle of modularity to design reusable code (multiple use of functions). | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;     | I can design algorithms to detect, intercept, and handle exceptions. | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;     | I can use workplace and professional conventions correctly to write programs and internal documentation (naming, indenting, commenting, function documentation). | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;     | I can interpret error messages displayed by programming tools during software creation. | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;     | I can design user-friendly software interfaces (in the console). | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;     | I can work independently, using support documentation, to write functioning computer programs. | |
