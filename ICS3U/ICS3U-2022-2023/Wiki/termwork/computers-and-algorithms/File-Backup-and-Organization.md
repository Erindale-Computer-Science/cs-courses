# &#x1F4D9; File Backup and Organization

## Task(s)

### File Backup

Multiple times throughout the semester, you will be assessed on your ability to backup all the work that you have created in this course. The reasoning for this is in case replit disappears at some point throughout the semester, you will have backup copies of your work so that you do not have to redo the work from scratch.

### File Organization

Multiple times throughout the semester, you will be assessed on your ability to organize your files. The majority of your work will be on replit, and it will be up to you to ensure that:

* Your files are organized within your labs and assignments
* Your lab/assignment submissions align with the task(s) assigned
