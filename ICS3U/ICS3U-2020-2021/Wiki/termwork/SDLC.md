# &#x1F4D9; Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Task(s)

This is a multi-step assignment, take your time to ensure you are completing them properly.

### Task 1 (SDLC Basics)
You are to go through the SDLC process as if you were creating a particular program as requested by your teacher (this will be provided by your teacher).

Using your knowledge of the SDLC complete the following tasks.
* Complete an analysis of what the program would need/require to work properly.  Create a bullet-point list of what you believe would be necessary for this program to work.
* Create a high-level flowchart of the program and how it would work.  You are aiming for approximately 15-20 symbols.
* Create a visual design of what your application would look like upon completion.  To do this, you would complete rough sketches (or using a digital painting program) to design what your program would look like.

### Task 2 (Hardware Understanding)
After showing your teacher your Task 1 work, they will give you a specific scenario that could occur within your program.  You are to create a step-by-step list (think 20-40 steps) showing your understanding of how the scenario works from a hardware perspective.

Within that step-by-step list, you **_must_** have a highly detailed breakdown of **one** of the following computer components, by including the required specifications in your response.

| Hardware part option    | Required specifications to include |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Central Processing Unit | Arithmetic logic unit, Memory management unit, cache, clock rate        |
| Hard Disk Drive **or** <br/> Solid State Drive  |  Reading/writing of data, cache, units of space |
| Random Access Memory (volatile)    | Reading/writing of data, addressing, speed  |
| Video/Graphics Card     | GPU, Video memory, RAMDAC, 1 of the output interfaces (VGA, DVI, HDMI, etc.) | 


### Example
[This is an example](http://mrseidel.com/exemplars/SDLC-example-2020.pdf) of what your products _could_ look like if you were asked to create the above regarding Twitter.  This is **not** level 4 work, but just an idea to get you started.

### Extra Information
#### Websites and Applications
There are multiple website applications that can help you with developing screenshots and flowcharts.  Remember that **if you sign up for any online tools** that you are to use your <student#>@pdsb.net account, and do **not** use your real name for anything.  **This is for your personal safety and privacy**.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Your bullet-point analysis, high-level flowchart, screenshots, and in-depth hardware flowchart are to be handed in to the appropriate folder.  Ensure that your submission follows the submission guidelines as described below.

Please see the [due dates and submission details](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS3U.jpg) for this include _Projects and Algorithms_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to effectively use the software development life cycle to plan and design computer programs. &#x1F4D9;

| Learning Goal | Success Criteria  | Learning and Improvement Comments |
