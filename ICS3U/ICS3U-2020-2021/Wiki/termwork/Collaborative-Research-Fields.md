# &#x1F4D7; Collaborative Research Fields

## Task(s)

This is a multi-step assignment, take your time to ensure you are completing them properly.

### Task 1 (Collaborative Research)
Choose another field of studies (arts, geography, social science, etc.) and complete some research to determine how this field of study collaborates with computer science to develop a product.  After completing the above, you will want to identify what the collaborative research field would be called (some examples include: bioinformatics, climatology, economics, geology, health informatics, linguistics, sociology, etc.)

### Task 2 (Complete In-depth Research)
Based on your choices in Task 1 above, complete research to determine the following:
* Find multiple post-secondary programs that lead to a career in the collaborative field.
* Find trends relating to the career above relating to the outlook of the career.  
	* Find trends locally (Ontario), nationally (Canada), and abroad (anywhere but Ontario or Canada). 
	* Examples of trends can include how the career has done in the past (pay, amount of jobs, etc.) and how they are forecast to be in the future.
* Find groups or programs that support students at a high-school level that interested in pursuing this career.
* Find environmental groups or community partners that work help guide people in this collaborative field in making sustainable and environmentally-conscious decisions/policies in their workplace.  This can be at either a local (Ontario), national (Canada), or international level.
* Identify a piece of software that is used exclusively in the collaborative field (i.e. ArcGIS in geology), and describe possible ways that this piece of software can (or could) be used to support environmental protection measures.
	*  Do **not** choose something simple that can be found in any career (word processor, spreadsheet, presentation, etc.). 

### Task 3 (Create a Report)
Upon completing research, you will want to collate your data into the following report format (template to be provided at a later time).

### Task 4 (Citations)
Cite your work using APA, MLA, or Chicago format (whichever one you want) in the citations section of the template provided.
Cite all images used.  You can use just hyperlinks for the citing of **images**.

## Due Dates and Submission Details
Your teacher will review your work and might present you with follow-up questions based on the content that you submitted. Be prepared to answer any questions related to your topic, and ensure understanding of all acronyms you use in your work.

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.
