Assignment **not** included in final grade.  Minimal work was completed overall, and this assignment has been removed from assessment and evaluation of the course.

## Task(s)
According to environmental resources, we are approaching the _Sixth Mass Extinction Event_ ([source][1], [source][2], [source][3], [source][4], [source][5], [source][6],) within the next 20-150 years (depending on source).

After reading through the attached articles, on your own, or in pairs, you are tasked with creating an awareness campaign of the environmental problems that the earth is facing.  You are to focus on how electronics, consumerism, and e-waste are contributing factors to the issue at hand.  It might prove useful to contact a local organization that deals with these issues to help get yourself started.

This campaign will take a while to create and complete, so it is expected that you start working on this immediately, and the [due date](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) that is given is when the campaign will end.

The teacher will be checking in periodically to see what you have completed for this campaign.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.
