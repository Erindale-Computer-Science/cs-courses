## Task(s)

Find a teacher in another department (not the Technology department), and find out how _computer science_ is used in their field.  For example, if you spoke with a visual arts teacher, they could respond with animation as an example field.

Using the teacher you spoke to as a _first contact_, ask them where they think you can find more information.  At this point, complete research based on the guidance of the teacher that you spoke with.

Once you have researched the topic, complete a report that talks about how _computer science_ is used within the field chosen.  You can complete this report in any format of your choosing.

Be prepared to discuss your work and present-to-the-teacher the information that you have found.  Include the teacher you spoke with as a source in your cited sources.
