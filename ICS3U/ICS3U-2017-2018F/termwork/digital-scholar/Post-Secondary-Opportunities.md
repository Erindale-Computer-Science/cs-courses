## Task
Contact at least two people in the _Computer Science_ field to find out what a typical day looks like for them, and find out what schooling they completed in order to work their job.  One person should be considered local (within Ontario), and another would be an international contact (either national or international).

Once you have all of the information, create a word processing file to organize your findings.  Include proof of contact, and proof that the person is actually someone in the correct field.

As proof of contact, you could include a screenshot of your discussion with the person.  If you speak to them over the phone, please include the phone number you called, who you spoke with, and what day/time you spoke with the person.
