**Important**: This task is for semester #1 **only**.  There will be another task for Semester 2.

## Task(s)
You are to complete this task on your own, **or in pairs**, (i.e. no group submissions, no plagiarizing from each other (or internet), etc.)  

* Create a _**design and flowchart**_ for your program **before** starting on the code.  This must be shown to the teacher prior to coding.
* Create a program that:
  * generates Bingo cards in a variety of number systems (Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal)
  * uses random numbers for the values (as per below)
  * outputs the cards to a [PDF file](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/pdf/index.html) for easy printing of the cards
  * outputs the cards in a visually pleasing manner
  * can, if requested, generate more than one bingo card as required
  * can, if requested, generate more than one file's worth of cards
  * has the option to leave the center spot as a _FREE_ option, or as another number.

See example pictures [here](./images/bingo_decimal.png) and [here](./images/bingo_binary.png) for ideas of what a sample output **could** look like.

As per usual, your program **cannot** have:
  * Flashing colours in it
  * Similarity to exercises

| Number System | B | I | N | G | O |
| ------------- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Binary | 1 to 10 | 11 to 20 | 21 to 30 | 31 to 40 | 41 to 50 |
| Octal | 1 to 30 | 31 to 60 | 61 to 90 | 91 to 120 | 121 to 150 |
| Decimal | 1 to 15 | 16 to 30 | 31 to 45 | 46 to 60 | 61 to 75 |
| Hexadecimal | 1 to 50 | 51 to 100 | 101 to 150 | 151 to 200 | 201 to 250 |

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goals](./images/ICS3U.jpg) for this include **both** _Programming Concepts_, and _Computational Analysis and Design_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to design and analyze algorithms for software solutions (CAD). 
  * We are learning to design and organize a computer program (PC).
  * We are learning to create simple computer programs (PC).
