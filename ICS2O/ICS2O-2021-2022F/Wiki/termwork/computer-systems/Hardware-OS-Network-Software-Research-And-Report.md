## &#x1F4D9; Task(s)

Individually, you will be researching one of 29 topics below.  You will become the _expert_ on the topic you've been given. You will produce a product that will be shared with the remainder of the classroom. The specific topic will be different depending on your teacher. This way you can teach and learn from each other. Other students will be relying on your expertise to complete the [next assignment](./Hardware-OS-Network-Software-Applying-Your-Knowledge).  

Your teacher will be choosing your topic for completing this project.  See your teacher about whether (or how) this assignment will be assessed.
