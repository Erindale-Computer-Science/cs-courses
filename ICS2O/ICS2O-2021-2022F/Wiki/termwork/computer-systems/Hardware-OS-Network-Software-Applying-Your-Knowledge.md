<summary>Client 1 (click to expand)</summary>

> **Occupation:** Author  
> **Budget:** $600 for hardware replacement, $25 / month for software, if necessary  
> **Letter received:** Hello, I'm hoping you can help me. I have a desktop computer that needs some hardware replaced on it. According to my friend, the motherboard is broken and I need to also replace my black and white laser printer. I'm currently using LibreOffice to complete all of my work, and my two colleagues and I are using SquareSpace as our web presence. We've also been trying to make use of Obsidian.md, but I'm not sure how much I like it. My colleagues and I have no data plan for our phones, and one of them brings in their tablet to complete some basic art for my books. I like the security of having a wired network connection for my Windows-based desktop, but I'm willing to use wireless connections for phones and tablets - I don't think there are other options, right? I'm not super comfortable with computers and tend to get my friends to help me out when I have problems.

> **Occupation:** Firefighter  
> **Budget:** $1000 for hardware replacement, $15 / month for software, if necessary  
> **Letter received:** I've heard you're the person to turn to for help. We recently had lightning strike the station and the power supply on one of ten Windows-based wired desktop computers stopped working, and it seems the surge also blew out the projector we use. Weird. Anyway, we're hoping you can help us fix that. Some of the others are also complaining that we rely too much on Microsoft with Office and OneNote, as well. Seems they aren't fans of Microsoft, do you have any suggestions for what to do there? We've also been using Wix for fundraisers, but we never did any research for what other options exist. Any help is appreciated.

<summary>Client 3</summary>

> **Occupation:** Artist  
> **Budget:** $400 for hardware replacement, $30 / month for software, if necessary  
> **Letter received:** My iMac is not starting. Someone suggested I replace the solid-state drive in the computer? I'm not sure what that is, I'm hoping you can help. I work alone and this is hurting business the longer this takes. What am I going to do with the three printers I have here? The ink will dry up in all of them: the colour one, the black and white laser one, and the big banner-sized inkjet one. Oh, just before the computer stopped starting up, some of the keys on the keyboard stopped working too, so I'll need another one of those. I don't have a lot of money for the parts, but it's the best I can do. This lug of a machine is just a paperweight over here by the window in the meantime. How did this thing even connect to the internet, there's no cable. I seem to be pondering aloud, hope you can help! Oh, almost forgot, I'm currently using Affinity Photo for the photo editing, Notion.so for brainstorming, and SquareSpace to sell my art. I think they're great tools, but my friend prefers other tools. What do you think?

<summary>Client 4</summary>

> **Occupation:** Realtor  
> **Budget:** $800 for hardware replacement, $20 / month for software, if necessary  
> **Letter received:** My Surface tablet is so awesome! I'm super happy with this purchase, I just don't know how to connect it to the internet at the house. Come to think of it, the two other people in the house don't have their phones connected to the internet at the house either. Only the desktop's connected. Speaking of which, I need it to go faster! My friend suggested a new CPU. I don't know what that is, but it needs to be fast! Like the houses I sell, they go fast! My friend stated that it had to be an Intel i7 or greater? Does that help you? I think my webcam isn't working right either, I can't remember. Anyways, I love Windows, it's super easy and just what I'm looking for. Similar to how Google Sheets works well for me, and my clients like when I use Microsoft OneNote. I do sometimes make brochures using Affinity Publisher. I don't know if they're the fastest, but if you know of something faster, let me know!

<summary>Client 5</summary>

> **Occupation:** Motivational Speaker  
> **Budget:** $400 for hardware replacement, $10 / month for software, if necessary  
> **Letter received:** My team of seven people just received their new computers, but they cannot connect to the internet. We need a good wired network setup, which should include the printer, scanner, and network attached storage (NAS) server. I was trying to be cheap with my computer, but it seems my audio card and headset are not working properly, so I have to spend more money to replace these things. I wanted to get some new software, as I'm really comfortable learning new technology and get really excited. I'm looking to dump Windows for something else. I'm using Microsoft Office and Microsoft OneNote for productivity tools, but I don't know if they'll work on another operating system. If not, what other options would you suggest? I also have a website up using Wordpress, but it's very basic. Any suggestions for that? Thanks for your time.

<summary>Client 6</summary>

> **Occupation:** Programmer  
> **Budget:** $200 for hardware replacement, $20 / month for software, if necessary  
> **Letter received:** My game-development company need to have our network setup for us over the weekend while we're on a retreat and we were hoping you could come in and do that for us. We have five wired desktops, and three freelancers that come in using their own laptops or Macbooks. Other than the Macbook user, we use Ubuntu Linux for everything. Oh right, while you're in there, one of the desktops needs to have its RAM replaced, as there's one stick that broke on us. We're looking for at least 8GB to replace what we had. We also are starting to do conferences, so we'll need a good set of speakers too. Set those up on the same computer. For software, since you're on that computer, when you get it up and running can you make sure that FileZilla, Discord, and Obsidian.md are downloaded to them. If not, can you grab something else that's similar? Thanks a bunch!

<summary>Client 7</summary>

> **Occupation:** Professional Gamer  
> **Budget:** $600 for hardware replacement, $30 / month for software, if necessary  
> **Letter received:** My income has been slowly increasing, so I'd like to improve on my equipment on this Windows computer. I need a new mouse, as the one I have doesn't have enough DPI for the games I'm starting to get into, and a new monitor with a better refresh rate than the one I have now. I have a few friends moving in with me in about a month - can you help set up a network for me? I need a wired connection so that I don't lag, but my friends aren't big gamers, so they can connect their laptops or phones or whatever via wireless connection. I think one of them is bringing in a wireless printer too? I've been selling merch on SquareSpace, have a Pico-based website for all of my achievements and updates, and finally I use Discord. Any suggestions for alternatives? I would like to keep Discord going though.

<summary>Client 8</summary>

> **Occupation:** Weaver  
> **Budget:** $1000 for hardware replacement, $35 / month for software, if necessary  
> **Letter received:** My custom clothing sales have been skyrocketing! I don't know whether Weebly is the right platform for me to sell my clothing line on, though. I'm looking to upgrade to Illustrator as the files it makes more easily transfers over to my digital loom. Is there anything better than Notion.so for me to create my designs or plan my designs on? I'm super excited this has been going so well! I think I'll need to upgrade my graphics card to something more modern, as my clothing design software is starting to lag. Maybe it's Windows? But that's all I know is Windows. I could probably use a scanner too! Something that I can scan photos in on so that I can make use of what I design by hand. Anyways, some family members have been needing access to the internet with their phone, tablet, and laptop as they are visiting, but I don't have the network set up for that, help! Thanks!

<summary>Client 9</summary>

> **Occupation:** Sound Production Engineer  
> **Budget:** $2000 for hardware replacement, $10 / month for software, if necessary  
> **Letter received:** My company is expanding. The iMac I have doesn't allow me to upgrade anything directly inside of it, so I'm looking for external hard drive solutions to back up my sound files on. Oh, and I'm looking to purchase a new condenser microphone, but I can be convinced to get a dynamic microphone as well. Can you give me a top choice of each microphone type so that I can make my decision from there? That would save me a lot of time. I make use of Logic X, Garageband, and Google Docs for most of my work. Any suggestions on alternatives, or other options I can add to the software solutions? My workflow for planning and cataloguing of work could use some help. I'm also taking on some interns, so my single wired connection directly to the modem will be insufficient. I have at least three interns coming soon, so if you could help me out with planning that out. I'm sure they'll be using their phones and laptops on the internet available here.

## Proposal Package

### Hardware

Within the client description, the client will have described two parts that they require replacement of. Using the information within the client block (if it exists: budget, part, company preference, etc.), decide on new hardware components to replace the hardware components requested. You must choose a brand new item, and not something used.  For each of the new components you chose:  
* Write 2-3 sentences to describe each components' purpose in the overall function of the computer
* Write 2-3 sentences describing your reason for choosing that particular component ("cheapest", "best", "highest reviews", or similar responses are insufficient). Use component-specific terminology.

### Operating System

Within the client description, the client will have described the operating system they were using at the time. Using the information within the client block (if it exists: what the client does for work, their daily practice, routine, etc.):  
* Write 3-4 sentences that includes reasoning for why the client should stay with their current operating system.
* Write 3-4 sentences that includes a counter-argument on reasons for why the client could consider a different operating system.

For example, if the client currently uses Windows as their operating system, for the first portion you would talk about why they should continue to use Windows, and for the second portion you could speak about MacOS, ChromeOS, or Linux, if applicable.

### Networking

Within the client description, the client will have described the electronic devices that need to connect to their network. Using the information within the client block (if it exists: how many computers exist, do they have wireless connections, do they need wired connections, etc.):  

* Create a diagram of how you would set up their network ([example mixed wireless/wired](https://nordvpn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/web_web-network-1200x675-2.jpg), [example wired](https://nordvpn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/web_web-network-1200x675-1.jpg), etc.). Ensure in your diagram you include all of the computers explained in the client's description, and that it is easy to identify if something is connected wirelessly or wired.

### Software

Within the client description, the client will have described some software requirements and their current maintenance/backup strategies. Using the information within the client block (if it exists: budget, previous software used, comfort level, etc.):  

* Describe what software you would suggest to the client based on their requested needs.
* Write 2-3 sentences to justify each piece of software you are suggesting.
* Provide a preventative maintenance tip based on the client's comfort level, computer usage, and operating system.
* Provide a security practice that you would ensure is completed if you were in the client's shoes.
