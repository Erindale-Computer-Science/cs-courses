## &#x1F4D8;  Task(s)

* Choose an artistic piece that you will recreate using _at least_ ```ellipse```, ```rect```, ```line``` as your shapes.
* Using an **IPO Chart**, plan out how the user can interact with your drawing (this will help you figure out where/how you'll be using _input_, _variables_, keyboard input, mouse input, and `if` statements). (IPO example video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a10a11oxjrA))
* Create the planned program.

### Task Criteria

_Submit first (through Google Classroom / Brightspace):_

* Find an artistic image you plan to replicate
* Create an IPO chart for your program
* Submit a link to or copy of image **and** your IPO chart
* Await approval

_After teacher approval:_

* Create your program using everything that you have learned from Processing:
  * Documentation (Header / Comments)
  * Input (using mouse and keyboard commands) and Output (your drawing)
    * include a comment on what it is being used for at the location you are using the button/key
  * Variables (built in and custom)
  * Conditional statements (including `if`, `else if`, `else`, `&&`, `||`, `<`, `>`, etc.) must be used.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

* For your final submission to Google Classroom / Brightspace submit: your IPO chart, a link to (or copy of) the art piece, and a link to your sketch.

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICS2O.jpg) for this is _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * _We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs._
  * _We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs._

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs_ | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | ------- |
| I can use a visual problem-solving model (i.e. IPO chart, storyboard) to plan the content of a program | |
| I can use correct terminology to describe programming concepts (data types, constants, variables) | |
| I can identify situations in which decision structures are required (if statements) | |

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs_ | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | ------- |
| I can use variables, expressions, and assignment statements to store and manipulate numbers and text in a program | |
| I can write a program that includes input and output (keyboard/mouse interaction) | |
| I can write clear and maintainable internal documentation to a specific set of standards (header, comments) | |
| I can write clear and maintainable code using proper programming standards (variable names, indenting) | |
| I can write a program that includes a decision structure for two or more choices (if statements) | |
