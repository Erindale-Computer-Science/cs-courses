# &#x1F4D8; Challenges

## Challenge 01 - Arcs
_This can be completed after Exercise 01._

Using your knowledge of Processing so far, recreate one of these two images ([image one][c1.1], [image two][c1.2]). Use a screen size of at least 640 pixels wide, and you should be using **only** the arc() function (and ellipse() for the little dots)

## Challenge 02 - Coloured Circles
_This can be completed after Exercise 02._

* Recreate [this sketch][c2.1] using the colours shown.

## Challenge 03 - Rainbow Circles
_This can be completed after Exercise 03._

* Recreate [this sketch][c3.1] using the colouring shown. You will need to use a different colour space to complete this task (HSB instead of RGB).

## Challenge 04 - Quadrants
_This can be completed after Exercise 05._

* Create a sketch that is split into four quadrants. When hovering over a quadrant with the mouse, it should change colour to denote that it is being hovered over.

## Challenge 05 - Half-Stuck Circle
_This can be completed after Exercise 05._

* Create a sketch that is split into two halves (vertical line in the middle). Have an ellipse follow your mouse normally whenever it is on the left-hand side of the sketch, but when the mouse is on the right half, the circle should can only follow in a vertical direction.
* See [this sketch][c5.1] for an example.

## Challenge 06 - Deflecting Walls
_This can be completed after Exercise 05._

* Create a sketch that has a circle deflects off of all the walls.

## Challenge 07 - Moving Clickable-Box
_This can be completed after Exercise 06._

* Recreate [this sketch][c7.1].
* Notable items for this sketch include the following:
  * The arrow keys move the black square around
  * When you click the mouse within the bounds of the square, it changes fill to green while the mouse it held
  * Any other time you click, nothing occurs
* For an added challenge, ensure the square cannot leave the screen.

## Challenge 08 - Many Lines
_This can be completed after Exercise 07._

* Recreate [this sketch][c8.1].
* To complete this task, you will need to use `random()`, `line()`, and `for()` loops. The lines should **not** move or change size as your program runs.

## Challenge 09 - Many Shades of Purple
_This can be completed after Exercise 08._

* Recreate [this sketch][c9.1].
* To complete this task, you will need to use the `%` operator (the modulo operator), and `while` loops.
