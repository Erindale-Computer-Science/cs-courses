## Task(s)

1. Create a complex repeating pattern.  Whenever you find something that you are satisfied with, save a copy of your program and update your program to create a whole new pattern.  See the _Task Criteria_ information below for more details.

### Task Criteria

1. Create and hand in a minimum of 3 different patterns that you created (maximum 5).
2. Hand in a document that details your journey from the 1st pattern to the 2nd, and from the 2nd to the 3rd.  Describe what choices you made from a programming aspect that led you from one pattern to another.
3. Ensure that you demonstrate all of your Processing knowledge up to and including _looping structures_.

### Example submission (for demonstration purposes only):

##### Images
[Pattern A](./images/pattern_a.PNG) -> [Pattern B](./images/pattern_b.PNG) -> [Pattern C](./images/pattern_c.PNG).

##### (Short) Explanation: 
* Pattern A was random generated, where if a certain colour in the centre of the circle occurred, then it was changed to a white centre with a green outline.

* Pattern B was a slight modification to Pattern A visually, but technically more difficult.  The same process was taken, but then lines were added from the centre of the program to the centre of the white/green circles.

* Pattern C has the white circles changed to rectangles, but **all** of the white rectangles are drawn underneath all of the greyscale circles.
