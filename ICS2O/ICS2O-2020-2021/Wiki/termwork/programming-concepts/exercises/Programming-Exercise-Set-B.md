# &#x1F4D8; Exercise Set (B)

For all of these exercises, do **not** hand them in, just ensure your teacher sees the work to ensure you are on the right track.  It is highly suggested that you complete these 3 exercises **prior** to attempting [Processing - Assignment 2](./Processing-Assignment-2)

## Exercise 4
1. Recreate this [image](http://mrseidel.com/images/Processing/2O/Exercise5_2O.gif). You will need variables and if statements to complete this exercise.

## Exercise 4b
1. This exercise requires the use of `key`, `keyCode`, `mouseIsPressed`, and `keyIsPressed`, as well as `if` statements and variables.  The exercise can be found [here](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1140787).

## Exercise (Optional, Moving Box)
1. This optional exercise requires the use of similar concepts to Exercise 4b above; however, the box only changes colour when you click _inside_ the box.  Otherwise, it doesn't change colour.  The exercise can be found [here](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1140920).


## Exercise 5
1. Recreate the image below.  Each set of shapes is created with ```for``` loops.  For example, there is only one ```triangle``` line of code, but the ```for``` loop draws multiple triangles.

## Exercise 6
1. Recreate the image below. Use ```while``` loops to complete this task.  You can technically complete this task using ```for``` loops, but it is expected that you practice using ```while``` loops.

## Bonus Exercise
1. Work on this if you complete Exercise 6 + 7 early.
2. Recreate the image below.  You will need to make use of the ```%``` operator, and ```while``` loops.

## What's next?
If you have completed all of the exercises above, you can try the [conditionals challenges](https://github.com/johnfraserss/ICS2O/blob/master/Programming%20Challenges/01%20-%20Conditionals.md) and [for loop challenges](https://github.com/johnfraserss/ICS2O/blob/master/Programming%20Challenges/02%20-%20Loops.md) found on the website while waiting to start on [Assignment 2](./Programming-Assignment-2).
