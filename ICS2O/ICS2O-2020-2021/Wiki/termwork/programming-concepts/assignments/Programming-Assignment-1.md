## &#x1F4D8;  Task(s)

* Choose an artistic piece that you will recreate using _at least_ ```ellipse```, ```rect```, ```line``` as your shapes.
* Using an **IPO Chart**, plan out how the user can interact with your drawing (this will help you figure out where/how you'll be using _input_, _variables_, _`keyPressed()`_, and _`mouseClicked()`_). (IPO example video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a10a11oxjrA))
* Create the planned program.

### Task Criteria

_Submit first (through Google Classroom):_

* Find an artistic image you plan to replicate
* Create an IPO chart for your program
* Submit a link to or copy of image **and** your IPO chart
* Await approval

_After teacher approval:_

* Create your program using everything that you have learned from Processing:
  * Documentation (Header / Comments)
  * Input (using `mouse` and `keyboard` commands) and Output (your drawing)
  * Variables (built in and custom)
  * Make use of the `mousePressed()` and `keyPressed()` functions
    * In the functions, describe what you are using them for

## Due Dates and Submission Details

* In Google Classroom submit: your IPO chart, a link to (or copy of) the art piece, and a link to your OpenProcessing sketch.

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICS2O.jpg) for this is _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * _We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs._
  * _We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs._

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs_ | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | ------- |
| I can use a visual problem-solving model (i.e. IPO chart, storyboard) to plan the content of a program | |
| I can use correct terminology to describe programming concepts | |
| I can describe the function of Boolean, comparison, and **arithmetic operators** | |

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs_ | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | ------- |
| I can use variables, expressions, and assignment statements to store and manipulate numbers and text in a program | |
| I can write a program that includes input and output | |
| I can write clear and maintainable code using proper programming standards | |
| I can write clear and maintainable internal documentation to a specific set of standards | |
