## &#x1F4D8;  Task(s)

* Update [Assignment 1][a1] to include the use of _conditional statements_ (`if`) and _looping structures_ (`for` or `while`).  This is also your opportunity to improve on [Assignment 1][a1] criteria.
* Update your IPO Chart to include your planned conditionals and loops.
* Update the program.

### Task Criteria

1. For any [Assignment 1][a1] criteria you wish to have re-evaluated, you **must include what you would like re-evaluated in your documentation header**. 
 Include line number(s) on where to find the corrections.  You will be provided with an example.
2. If statements (including `else if`, `else`, `&&`, `||`, `<`, `>`, etc.) must be used.
3. Multiple looping structures (`for` or `while`) must be used (some examples could include: 2 uses of `for`, 3 uses of `while`, 1 use of `for` and 1 use of `while`, etc.).

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICS2O.jpg) for this is _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * _We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs._
  * _We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs._

You will be assessed on the following new Success Criteria, as well as any improvements needed from the previous assignment.

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs_ | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | ------- |
| I can describe the function of **Boolean**, **comparison**, and arithmetic operators | |
| I can identify situations in which decision structures are required | |
| I can identify situations in which looping structures are required. | |


| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs_ | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | ------- |
| I can write a program that includes a decision structure for two or more choices | |
| I can write a program that includes looping structures.  | |
