Task(s)
-------

**This task is worth 15% of your final mark (15 of the 30% culminating mark)**

Create a program using **Processing** that displays the **name** of your **favourite historical figure** (real, or fiction) on the screen that shows your understanding of all of the Processing concepts you learned up to this point in the course.  Do **not** just use the ```text()``` function to place the name on the screen.  You are _forming_ the name using the concepts learned.

See the example from previous years [here](http://mrseidel.com/culminating/2O_Culminating_Seidel.gif).

### Concepts Taught
* color, strokeWeight, strokeJoin, fill, noFill, stroke, noStroke
* ellipse, rect, arc, line
* mouseX, mouseY
* random values
* variables
* if statements
* loops (for and while)
* _any other concepts you learned along the way that was not taught can be included.  If you are using something that was **not** taught in class, be prepared to explain it in a conversation with your teacher_



Submissables & Due Date(s)
----------
**Mr. Seidel's Class**: Due **June 19th, 2017 by end of class** to the IN drive.  
**Mr. Lightbody's Class**: See your teacher for due dates and how to submit your work
