Task(s)
-------
You are to complete this task on your own (i.e. no group submissions, or no plagiarizing from each other (or internet), etc.)

* Using your knowledge of programming and if statements you will recreate the sketch found in the ```OUT\Seidel\ICS2O\Assignment 1 folder```
* You can use only ```arc()``` for the **moving** shapes that move in a circular trajectory.
* There are two version of the assignment:
  * One has a maximum mark threshold of level 3+, and 
  * The other has a maximum mark threshold of level 4+.



Submissables
------------
Do **not** hand this work in - your teacher will mark this at your computer near the due date.  
Be prepared to explain your code and change a portion of your code as requested.


Due Date(s)
----------
Marking will begin at the beginning of class on:  
**Mr. Seidel's Class:**  April 13th, 2017  (due date moved up due to the pace of the entire class)  
**Mr. Lightbody's Class:** _see your teacher for information_


Rubric(s)
---------
**Your teacher might use a different rubric than below.  Please see your teacher for information.**
<br/><br/>

Example of how to read the rubric below:
* The overall sections (_B1_, _B2_ and _B3_) will be used to generate a mark
* The subsections (e.g. _B1.1_, _B1.3_, etc.) will be used to assess your understanding of the overall sections.
  * For example, _B1.1_, _B1.3_, _B1.4_, _B1.5_ and _B1.6_ will be used to generate a level for section _B1_ and so on through the various sections.
