Task(s)
-------
You are to complete this task on your own (i.e. no group submissions, or no plagiarizing from each other (or internet), etc.)

* Using your knowledge of programming, if statements, and looping structures recreate the sketch found in the OUT\Seidel\ICS2O\Assignment 2 folder
* You **must** use ```for``` loops or ```while``` loops to complete any of the levels of the assignment (higher than level 1).
* If you don't use loops (i.e. type out all of the ellipses and/or rectangles as separate items), your maximum mark is a Level 1+
* There are videos for level 2, 3, and 4 options.
