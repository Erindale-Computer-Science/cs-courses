Task(s)
-------

**This task is worth 15% of your final mark (15 of the 30% culminating mark)**

Create a **website** that contains the following **webpages** with a menu connecting them all.  On each webpage, you will be reflecting on the previous non-programming assignments.  Your specific page reflections for each section are below:
* __Post Secondary__: Will you ever create another computer program in your life?  If not, why not? If yes, will you be taking computer studies in a post-secondary environment? Why/Why not?
* __Hardware__: Describe why hardware knowledge is important to a computer programmer.
* __Operating Systems__: *Microsoft* and *Apple* go bankrupt, leaving the world only one operating system choice: Linux.  Explain which distribution you would choose, why you would choose that particular one and how you would make the transition to Linux.  If you were never forced to, would you ever use Linux? Why/Why not?
* __Networking__: You are transported back 100 years without any electronic devices.  Describe how would you adapt to your new lifestyle.
* __SDLC and Flowcharting__: Who **actually** does this? What's the point? How often did you do this for your Processing programs?
* __Ethics__: Based on the number given to you for this section (see below), choose the associated bullet point from [this page](http://www.gammadyne.com/ethics.htm).  For example, if you were given the number 10, you are going to complete this section using the 10th bullet point.  Explain what the consequences would be of **not** following this particular code of ethics?
* __Environmental__: According to environmental resources, we are approaching the _Sixth Mass Extinction Event_ ([source][1], [source][2], [source][3], [source][4], [source][5], [source][6],) within the next 20-150 years (depending on source). What do _you_ **_actually_** plan to do about it?


Include sources at the bottom of each webpage as necessary (APA, MLA or Chicago format)
