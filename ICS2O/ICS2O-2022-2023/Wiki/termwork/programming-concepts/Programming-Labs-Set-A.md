## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

This is a **verbal-feedback-only** section of the course.

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICS2O.jpg) for this is _Programming Concepts_.
The specific learning goal(s) for this include:

  * _We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs._
  * _We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs._

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs_ | Look Fors                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I can describe the types of data that computers can process and store. | * variety of types of data understood, <br/>* can speak to, in detail, multiple types of data |
| I can use correct terminology to describe programming concepts (data types, constants, variables). | * accurate use of terminology,<br/>* can use proper terminology verbally and in writing,<br/>* clarity of communication |
| I can explain the difference between constants and variables used in programming. (B1) | * understanding of the purpose of constants,<br/>* understanding of the purpose of variables,<br/>* can compare the differences |
| I can describe the function of Boolean, comparison, order of operations and arithmetic operators. (B1) | * understanding of Boolean expressions,<br/>* understand the location and use of Boolean expressions,<br/>* can describe the order of operations if given a scenario,<br/>* understands the difference between `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`,<br/>* understands the difference between `=`, `==`, and `===`. |
| I can identify situations in which decision structures are required (if statements) | * location of `if` statements,<br/>* location of `else if`,<br/>* location of `else` |

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I can use variables, expressions, and assignment statements to store and manipulate numbers and text in a program | * variables used have purpose,<br/>* variables are given appropriate values,<br/>* variables are modified over time,<br/>* variables are used, as necessary,<br/>* constants created and used, as necessary,<br/>* variables or constants used in if statement evaluations, as necessary,<br/>* variety of data types used as variables, as necessary |
| I can write a program that includes input (keyboard and mouse) and output (shown on screen) | * receive keyboard input, as necessary,<br/>* mouse input used, as necessary, |
| I can write a program that includes a decision structure for two or more choices (if statements) | * if statements are properly formatted,<br/>* if statement blocks include `else if` when appropriate,<br/>* if statements are separated into different blocks (instead of `else if`) when appropriate,<br/>* use of `else` statements, as necessary,<br/>* used appropriate operators (i.e. `||`, `&&`, `>`, etc.) |
| I can write clear and maintainable internal documentation to a specific set of standards (header, comments) | * clear, descriptive header,<br/>* header follows provided template,<br/>* comments exist above blocks of code,<br/>* comments are descriptive and easy to understand,<br/>* comments are appropriate to the block of code,<br/>* comments are _not_ on every line |
| I can write clear and maintainable code using proper programming standards (constant and variable names, indenting) | * variable names follow naming conventions,<br/>* variable naming convention chosen is consistently used throughout program,<br/>* variable names are descriptive to what they do,<br/>* constants following naming conventions,<br/>* indenting is completed per industry standards |
