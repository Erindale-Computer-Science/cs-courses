## &#x1F4D8;  Task(s)

* Choose an artistic piece that you will recreate using _at least_ ```ellipse```, ```rect```, ```line``` as your shapes.
* Using an **IPO Chart**, plan out how the user can interact with your drawing (this will help you figure out where/how you'll be using _input_, _variables_, keyboard input, mouse input, and `if` statements). (IPO example video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a10a11oxjrA))
* Create the planned program.

### Task Criteria

_Submit first (through Google Classroom / Brightspace):_

* Find an artistic image you plan to replicate
* Create an IPO chart for your program
* Submit a link to or copy of image **and** your IPO chart
* Await approval

_After teacher approval:_

* Create your program using the following:
  * Documentation (Header / Comments)
  * Input (using mouse and keyboard commands) and Output (your drawing)
    * include a comment on what it is being used for at the location you are using the button/key
  * Variables (built in and custom)
  * Conditional statements (including `if`, `else if`, `else`, `&&`, `||`, `<`, `>`, etc.) must be used.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

* For your final submission to Google Classroom / Brightspace submit: your IPO chart, a link to (or copy of) the art piece, and a link to your sketch.

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICS2O.jpg) for this is _Programming Concepts_.
The specific goal(s) for this include:

  * _Plan, write, and maintain simple programs._

You will be evaluated on the following success criteria.

| Success Criteria for <br/> _Plan, write, and maintain simple programs_ | Look Fors                                                    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| I can use variables, expressions, and assignment statements to store and manipulate numbers and text in a program | * variables used have purpose,<br/>* variables are given appropriate values,<br/>* variables are modified over time,<br/>* variables are used more than once,<br/>* constants created and used more than once,<br/>* variables or constants used in if statement evaluations,<br/>* variety of data types used as variables |
| I can write a program that includes input (keyboard and mouse) and output (shown on screen) | * receive keyboard input,<br/>* keyboard input is dissimilar to labs,<br/>* mouse input used,<br/>* mouse input is dissimilar to labs,<br/>* output is dissimilar to labs |
| I can write a program that includes a decision structure for two or more choices (if statements) | * if statements are properly formatted,<br/>* if statement blocks include `else if` when appropriate,<br/>* if statements are separated into different blocks (instead of `else if`) when appropriate,<br/>* use of `else` statements as necessary,<br/>* used a variety of operators (i.e. not just `==`) |
| I can write clear and maintainable internal documentation to a specific set of standards (header, comments) | * clear, descriptive header,<br/>* header follows provided template,<br/>* comments exist above blocks of code,<br/>* comments are descriptive and easy to understand,<br/>* comments are appropriate to the block of code,<br/>* comments are _not_ on every line |
| I can write clear and maintainable code using proper programming standards (constant and variable names, indenting) | * variable names follow naming conventions,<br/>* variable naming convention chosen is consistently used throughout program,<br/>* variable names are descriptive to what they do,<br/>* constants following naming conventions,<br/>* indenting is completed per industry standards |
