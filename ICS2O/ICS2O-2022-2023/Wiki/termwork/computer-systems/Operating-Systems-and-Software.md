## Reading: Open Source Software

This project will be focusing on open source software and alternatives. As such, read through [this](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) article about _what open source software is._

_Data for table above retrieved February 13, 2022_

Using the career you chose in the [Hardware Project](./Hardware-Project) and based on the information provided above, in a word-processing document respond to the following prompts:

* Linux might not seem like it has a large presence in the desktop world, but based on the table of information it is used in a _lot_ of other scenarios. Why might Linux have such a large presence in every space except the desktop/laptop domain? Include specific examples.
* Three of the most user-friendly Linux distributions include: [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/), [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), and [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/). If you were going into the career you decided upon previously, which would you choose and why?
* Based on the distribution you chose above:
  * Describe what features it possesses that would persuade someone from using Windows or MacOS to switch over to Linux?
  * What limitations exist in using this operating system over using something like Windows or MacOS?

Using the career you chose in the [Hardware Project](./Hardware-Project) choose at least two rows from the table above. In a word-processing document, respond to the following prompts for each row chosen:

* Why might someone in your chosen career want to use the open source alternatives over the commercial option? Justify your responses with specific examples.
* Describe the main feature(s) of the open source alternative(s) that would entice someone in the career you chose to use the open source software over the commercial software.
* Compare the open source alternative(s) with the commercial software including unique software features of each.
* Describe why it is important to update your open-source software on a regular basis.

For the above software choices, include at least one offline-only option available in the open-source community in case a user does not have internet access at all times.
