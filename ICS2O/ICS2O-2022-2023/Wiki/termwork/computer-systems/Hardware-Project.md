## &#x1F4D9; &#x1F4D7; Task(s)

## Reading / Video: Hardware Components

This portion of the project will be focusing on computer hardware components. You might need to refresh your understanding of the presentation materials, and can use this, if preferred: [Computer Hardware Basics](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/inside-a-computer/1/).

## Assignment Setup

#### Future Career Option

Choose a single career that you might be interested in after you have completed school. The only limitation is to choose a career that is **not** related to Computer Science/Engineering (Programmer, Analyst, Software Engineer, etc.).

#### Hardware Bundle Provided
You will be randomly provided with a specific set of hardware (see _Hardware Bundles_ chart below).

| Bundled Components                                 | Randomly Assigned<br/>Student # |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1. Central Processing Unit, Mouse      |           |
| 2. Random Access Memory, Keyboard   |     |
| 3. Graphics Card, Monitor |         |
| 4. Sound Card, Microphone              |   |
| 5. Solid State Drive, Scanner  |  |
| 6. Motherboard, Printer       |  |
| 7. Power Supply, Webcam         |   | 

#### Adaptive/Assistive Technology

Find an adaptive or assistive technology piece of **hardware** that relates to the peripheral component in the _Hardware Bundle_ above with the career above. See [this page](https://actcenter.missouri.edu/about-the-act-center/what-is-adaptive-technology/) for examples. 

## Document Creation
Based on the career you decided on and the hardware bundle you were provided, in a word-processing document respond to the following prompts:

* Summarize what the day-to-day life of someone working in the career looks like, including how this person might complete daily tasks using a computer. Limit your response to 150 words or less.
* For the career you chose, in 200 words or less, describe career trends at a Canadian level. Trends in careers could include topics such as: whether the salary has been going up or down over the years, how the popularity of the career has changed over time, whether there are more or less jobs available over time, etc.
* Choose a single college or university program _outside of Ontario_ related to the career you chose. In 150 words or less, describe why someone would choose this particular post-secondary institution over any other. Example topics to discuss could include: location, tuition, prestige, unique programs, etc.

The career that you described above will be using a computer to complete their daily tasks. With this in mind, respond to the following prompts based on the _Hardware Bundle_ that you were randomly assigned and _Adaptive/Assistive Technology_ you chose:

* Describe, in detail, what each of the parts in your bundle are used for, how they work, and why they're important to the function of a computer. Use terminology specific to each of the parts in your response such as: speed measurements, size measurements, power consumption, etc.
* Why would someone who works in your career believe each of these individual parts would be important for their daily work?
* Identify specific version of each computer component you could purchase from a store. With each item, choose one that would be considered a "budget" version and one that would be considered a "high end" version. For each item, using terminology that someone in Grade 3 could understand (~8 years old):
  * Identify the feature differences between the "budget" and "high end" version. 
  * Identify what benefits exist for the extra money that would be required to purchase the "high end" version.
* Describe how the adaptive/assistive technology assists someone in the career to complete their daily tasks on the computer. Include how it works.
* Identify where to purchase or acquire the adaptive/assistive technology described.

## Citations

For the above tasks, complete the following regarding citations:

* Cite your work using IEEE format.
* Cite all images used. You can provide a list of hyperlinks to the images used.


## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria
