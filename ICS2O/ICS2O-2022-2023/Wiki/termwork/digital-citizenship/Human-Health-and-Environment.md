## &#x1F4D7; Task(s)

This is a multi-step assignment. Ensure you take your time on each step.

## Complete Research

Complete research based on the following prompts:

* How can computers have a negative impact on **human health**?
* How can computers have a negative impact the **environment** (flora, fauna, water, rocks, etc.)?

## Create Visuals

Once you have all of your research, complete **all** of the following:

* Create a visual story via a poster or diorama that uses **no words**, that narratively describes the negative effects of computers on **human health** (physical health, mental health, etc.).  
* Create a mind map that shows the negative effects of computers on the environment. Your mind map should break things down into specific examples. Include imagery at final branches on the mind map.

Free online infographic tools are available [here](https://www.canva.com/create/infographics/), [here](https://piktochart.com/), and [here](https://venngage.com/).  There are more available if you don't like the ones above (a quick search using your favorite search engine will find you some more).

You have access to free mind map tools through the BYOD page. Your teacher will show you sample tools for creating mind maps.

## Supplemental Text for Human Health Poster

In a word-processing document, answer the following prompts:

* What is the overall narrative you are attempting to portray?
* Describe why you chose each particular image and how each of the images support that narrative. Provide specific justification.
* How might your visuals be misconstrued to have a different meaning? What might those alternative meanings be?

## Citations

* Cite your work using IEEE format.
* Cite all images used from the internet. You can provide a list of hyperlinks to the images used.
  * If you used images directly from an infographic tool, you do not have to cite those.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Submit your poster, mind map, and word-processing document.

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.
