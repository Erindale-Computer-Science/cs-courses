#### Client Letters

<details>
<summary>Client 1 (Author) (click to expand)</summary>

> **Occupation:** Author  
> **Budget:** \$997 for hardware replacement  
> **Letter received:** Hello, I'm hoping you can help me. I have a desktop computer that needs some hardware replaced on it. According to my friend, the motherboard is broken which they mentioned also means I need a new CPU and some RAM? I'm currently using Scrivener to complete all of my work, and my two colleagues and I are using SquareSpace as our web presence. We've also been trying to make use of Notion.so, but I'm not sure how much I like it. My colleagues and I have no data plan for our phones, and one of them brings in their tablet to complete some basic art for my books. I like the security of having a wired network connection for my Windows-based desktop, but I'm willing to use wireless connections for phones and tablets - I don't think there are other options, right? I'm not super comfortable with computers and tend to get my friends to help me out when I have problems.

<summary>Client 2 (Dentist)</summary>

> **Occupation:** Dentist  
> **Budget:** \$1000 for hardware replacement  
> **Letter received:** The computer used at the front desk of the office has broken down. I've been told I need to replace the monitor and graphics card? I'm also interested in changing out my printer for a combined scanner + laser printer so I can easily make photocopies of paperwork as necessary. Maybe it's Windows? But that's all I know is Windows. I've been using Microsoft Word to write up reports and also have been using Microsoft Access to store all my client information.  I'm hoping to offer a free Wi-Fi solution to any of my clients while they're out in the waiting room as well, but I'm not sure how to do that! Thank you for all your assistance.

<summary>Client 3 (Dietician)</summary>

> **Occupation:** Dietician  
> **Budget:** \$500 for hardware replacement  
> **Letter received:** I tend to do a lot of my work on my laptop these days, but I typically do some monthly reports on my desktop computer at home. The desktop's keyboard and mouse are not working well anymore, and the computer shuts down randomly here and there. Someone mentioned to me that it might be my power supply that is not working properly anymore. As such, I've been mainly using my Macbook laptop to get things done. To simplify the process of having files on both computers, I've been using Google Docs and Sheets for anything that is not sensitive client data. For that I've been using Excel on both the laptop and desktop, and just transfer the files via a USB drive. I've also been using Microsoft Publisher to make advertisement posters for my website. I would prefer to use the same application everywhere rather than having multiple types of applications. Privacy and security are my highest concerns, especially with all my client data. The one thing that has also been not working properly is my home internet. That's why I've been trying to get the desktop working at home since it's plugged in, and using the laptop on the road. I'd also like to have my family able to connect to the internet whenever they visit.</details>

<summary>Client 4 (eSports Professional Gamer)</summary>

> **Occupation:** eSports Professional Gamer  
> **Budget:** \$700 for hardware replacement  
> **Letter received:** My income has been slowly increasing, so I'd like to improve on my equipment on this Windows-based computer. I need a new mouse, as the one I have doesn't have enough DPI for the games I'm starting to get into, some more RAM and a new monitor with a better refresh rate than the one I have now. I have a few friends moving in with me in about a month - can you help set up a network for me? I need a wired connection so that I don't lag, but my friends aren't big gamers, so they can connect their laptops or phones or whatever via wireless connection. I think one of them is bringing in a wireless printer too? I've been selling merch on SquareSpace, have a Weebly-based website for all of my achievements and updates, and finally I use Discord. Any suggestions?

<summary>Client 5 (Firefighter)</summary>

> **Occupation:** Firefighter  
> **Budget:** \$900 for hardware replacement  
> **Letter received:** I've heard you're the person to turn to for help. We recently had lightning strike the station and the power supply on one of the two Windows-based wired desktop computers stopped working, and it seems the surge also blew out the motherboard and the projector we use. Weird. Anyway, we're hoping you can help us fix that. Some of the others are also complaining that we rely too much on Microsoft with Office and OneNote, as well. Seems they aren't fans of Microsoft, do you have any suggestions for what to do there? We've also been using Wix for fundraisers, but we never did any research for what other options exist. Any help is appreciated.

<summary>Client 6 (Graphic Designer)</summary>

> **Occupation:** Graphic Designer  
> **Budget:** \$500 for hardware replacement  
> **Letter received:** My iMac is not starting. Someone suggested I replace the solid-state drive in the computer? I'm not sure what that is, I'm hoping you can help. They also mentioned adding in some more RAM? I work alone and this is hurting business the longer this takes. What am I going to do with the three printers I have here? The ink will dry up in all of them: the colour one, the black and white laser one, and the big banner-sized inkjet one. Oh, just before the computer stopped starting up, some of the keys on the keyboard stopped working too, so I'll need another one of those. I don't have a lot of money for the parts, but it's the best I can do. This lug of a machine is just a paperweight over here by the window in the meantime. How did this thing even connect to the internet, there's no cable. I seem to be pondering aloud, hope you can help! Oh, almost forgot, I'm currently using Affinity Photo for the photo editing, Notion.so for brainstorming, and SquareSpace to sell my art. I think they're great tools, but my friend prefers other tools. What do you think?

<summary>Client 7 (Photographer)</summary>

> **Occupation:** Photographer  
> **Budget:** \$1500 for hardware replacement  
> **Letter received:** My company is expanding. The iMac I have doesn't allow me to upgrade anything but the RAM directly inside of it, so I'm looking for external hard drive solutions to back up my photography files on. I'm looking to dabble in some videography and podcasting in the next year or so and was advised to pick up a condenser microphone for the computer since I have a quiet space to do my work. Can you give me a top choice of this particular type of microphone? I know they can be expensive, but that would save me a lot of time. Maybe I should upgrade the RAM while I'm at it - can you suggest any for me? For software, I make use of Logic X, Garageband, and Google Docs for most of my work. Any suggestions on alternatives, or other options I can add to the software solutions? My workflow for planning and cataloguing of work could use some help as well. I'm also taking on some interns, so my single wired connection directly to the modem will be insufficient. I have at least three interns coming soon, so if you could help me out with planning that out. I'm sure they'll be using their phones and laptops on the internet available here.

<summary>Client 8 (Real Estate Agent)</summary>

> **Occupation:** Real Estate Agent  
> **Budget:** \$999 for hardware replacement  
> **Letter received:** My Surface tablet is so awesome! I'm super happy with this purchase, I just don't know how to connect it to the internet at the house. Come to think of it, the two other people in the house don't have their phones connected to the internet at the house either. Only the desktop's connected. Speaking of which, I need it to go faster! My friend suggested a new CPU. I don't know what that is, but it needs to be fast! Like the houses I sell, they go fast! My friend stated that it had to be an Intel i7 or greater, and I need some more... "DDR4" RAM? Does that help you? I think my webcam isn't working right either, I can't remember. Anyways, I love Windows, it's super easy and just what I'm looking for. Similar to how Google Sheets works well for me, and my clients like when I use Microsoft OneNote. I do sometimes make brochures using Affinity Publisher. I don't know if they're the fastest, but if you know of something faster, let me know!</details>

<summary>Client 9 (Veterinarian)</summary>

> **Occupation:** Veterinarian  
> **Budget:** \$1200 for hardware replacement  
> **Letter received:** My team of seven people just received their new computers, but they cannot connect to the internet. We need a good wired network setup, which should include the printer, scanner, and network attached storage (NAS) server. I was having difficulties settling on some hardware components since we've gone partially remote. We have the animals in the examination rooms, where there are computers, and think that having good webcams and headsets would prove useful for communicating with owners as they wait out in the waiting room, their vehicles, or at home. Do you have any suggestions for those? I was also told that I ordered the wrong computer for the reception area, and forgot to order 16GB of RAM for it, but only ordered 8GB. If you could put together a quote on that as well. I wanted to get some new software, as I'm really comfortable learning new technology and get really excited. We're currently set up to use Windows, but I'd be open to other options. We're using Microsoft Office and Microsoft OneNote for productivity tools, but I don't know if they'll work on another operating system. If not, what other options would you suggest? The clinic's website is up using Wordpress, but it's very basic. Any other suggestions for that? Thanks for your time.

## Proposal Package

**Individually**, you will be putting together a **5-part proposal package** for a potential client, as assigned above. A portion of this package will be you attempting to educate your client, and the other part of this package is you providing concrete suggestions to the client. Think of this as a formal written report that could include graphs or diagrams to assist your writing. Each section below will have different prompts for you to respond to. Consider each section below as a header in the formal report.

### Hardware

Within the client description, the client will have described three parts that they require replacement of. Using the information within the client block (if it exists: budget, part, company preference, etc.), decide on specific new hardware components as replacements. You must choose a brand new item, and not something used.  For each of the new components you chose:  

* Write 2-3 sentences to describe each components' purpose in the overall function of the computer to help the client understand why the item they are replacing is a vital piece of hardware.
* Write 2-3 sentences describing your reason for choosing that particular component ("cheapest", "best", "highest reviews", or similar responses are insufficient). Use component-specific terminology.

### Networking

Within the client description, the client will have described the electronic devices that need to connect to their network. Using the information within the client block (if it exists: how many computers exist, do they need wired or wireless connections, etc.):  

* Create a diagram of how you would set up their network ([example mixed wireless/wired](https://nordvpn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/web_web-network-1200x675-2.jpg), [example wired](https://nordvpn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/web_web-network-1200x675-1.jpg), etc.). 
  * Include all of the electronics in the client's description, and 
  * It should be easy to identify if something is connected wirelessly or wired, and
* Write 3-4 sentences that explains the benefits of wireless over wired, and 
* Write 3-4 sentences that explains the benefits of wired over wireless.

### Operating System

Within the client description, the client will have described the operating system they were using at the time. Using the information within the client block (if it exists: what the client does for work, their daily practice, routine, etc.):  

* Write 3-4 sentences that includes reasoning for why the client should stay with their current operating system. Include features that only exist in the operating system they are currently using that would benefit the client.
* Write 3-4 sentences that includes a counter-argument on reasons for why the client should consider switching to Linux. Include which Linux distribution you would suggest and why.

### Software

Within the client description, the client will have described some software requirements. Using the information within the client block (if it exists: previous software used, comfort level, etc.):  

* Describe what **open source software** you would suggest to the client based on their requested needs. This piece of software needs to be usable in both their existing operating system and Linux.
* Write 2-3 sentences that shows how the client can complete the same daily tasks using the open source software you chose.
* Write 2-3 sentences to justify each piece of software you are suggesting.

### Security and Maintenance

Based on the operating system that your client currently uses:

* Provide a preventative maintenance tip based on the client's comfort level, computer usage, and operating system.
* Provide a security practice that the client would want to do on a weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. Include one practice per timeframe.

Based on the idea that the user took your counter-argument suggestion earlier into account and wants to switch to Linux:

* Provide preventative maintenance suggestions based on the distribution of Linux you suggested.
* Provide a security practice that the client would want to do on a weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. Include one practice per timeframe.
