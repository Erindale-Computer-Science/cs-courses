_Data for table above retrieved February 13, 2022_

Based on the information provided above, in a word-processing document respond to the following prompts:

* Linux might not seem like it has a large presence in the desktop world, but based on the table of information it is used in a _lot_ of other scenarios. Why might Linux have such a large presence in every space except the desktop/laptop domain? Include specific examples.
* Three of the most user-friendly Linux distributions include: [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/), [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), and [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/). If you had to choose one to use for yourself, which would you choose and why?
* Based on the distribution you chose above:
  * Describe which career(s) would benefit most by using this particular distribution of Linux?
  * Describe what features it possesses that would persuade someone from using Windows or MacOS to switch over to Linux?
  * What limitations exist in using this operating system over using something like Windows or MacOS?
* Describe a system maintenance practice you would have to perform in Windows or MacOS that you would not have to do in Linux?
* How can you increase the security of the computer you are using to type up your responses to these prompts?

Many software applications have something similar that can be found in the open source software realm. Using the table above:

* Choose one row from Group A, and one row from _either_ group B _or_ group C, then
* Think of a specific career that uses the software in the rows you chose, then

In a word-processing document, respond to the following prompts:

* Why might the person in your chosen career want to use the open source alternatives over the commercial option? Justify your responses with specific examples.
* Describe the main feature(s) of the open source alternative(s) that would entice someone in the career you chose to use the open source software over the commercial software.
* Compare the open source alternative(s) with the commercial software including unique software features of each.
* If the person in the career you chose was someone who was concerned with their security and privacy, what benefit does the open source alternative provide over the commercial option(s)? Include known security or privacy policy information as part of your comparison.

## Citations
