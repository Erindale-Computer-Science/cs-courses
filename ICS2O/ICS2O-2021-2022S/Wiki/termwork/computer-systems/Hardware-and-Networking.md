You will be randomly provided with a specific set of hardware (see _Hardware Bundles_ chart above), and a particular career (see _Career List_ above). 

Based on the combination that you received, in a word-processing document respond to the following prompts:

* Summarize what the day-to-day life of someone working in the career looks like.
* How this person might complete daily tasks using a computer. Provide at least two specifically different scenarios.

The career that you described above will be using a computer to complete their daily tasks. With this in mind, respond to the following prompts based on the Hardware Bundle that you were randomly assigned:

* Describe, in detail, what each of the parts in your bundle are used for, how they work, and why they're important to the function of a computer. Use terminology specific to each of the parts in your response such as: speed measurements, size measurements, power consumption, etc.
* Why would someone who works in your career believe each of these individual parts would be important for their daily work?
* Identify specific version of each computer component you could purchase from a store. With each item, choose one that would be considered a "budget" version and one that would be considered a "high end" version. For each item, using terminology that someone in Grade 3 could understand (~8 years old):
  * Identify the feature differences between the "budget" and "high end" version. 
  * Identify what benefits exist for the extra money that would be required to purchase the "high end" version.

The hardware information you provided can now be used in specific scenarios. With this in mind, respond to the following prompt(s) that combine your responses from above:

* For each of the scenarios you identified above for how a person in this career might complete daily tasks using a computer, identify whether the budget versions are sufficient to complete the tasks, or whether the high end versions would be required. Justify your choices.

## Reading / Video: Networking Hardware

This portion of the project will be focusing on networking hardware components. As such, you'll want to use this reference as a starting point: [Computer Networking Basics](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/connecting-to-the-internet/1/).



## Networking

In a word-processing document, respond to the following prompts:

* What networking hardware components are needed to set up a wired connection, assuming you only have one computer to set up? Include _all_ necessary hardware, assuming you have nothing available.
* What networking hardware components are needed to set up a wireless connection, assuming you have multiple computers, phones, tablets, and laptops to set up? Include _all_ necessary hardware, assuming you have nothing available.
* What benefits are there to having a wired connection? Justify your response.
* What benefits exist when using wireless connections? Provide multiple examples or scenarios in your response.
* If you lived in a forest and had no underground cables running to your house, how might you connect to the internet? What if there was no cell reception at the house? Provide an example internet service provider for all options you are able to find.

## Citations

For the above tasks, complete the following regarding citations:

* Cite your work using APA, MLA, or Chicago format (whichever one you want).
* Cite all images used. You can provide a list of hyperlinks to the images used.
