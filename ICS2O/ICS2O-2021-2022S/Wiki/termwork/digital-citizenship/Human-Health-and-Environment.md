## &#x1F4D7; Task(s)

This is a multi-step assignment. Ensure you take your time on each step.

## Complete Research

Complete research on the following four human health and environmental topics:

* How can computers have a negative effect on **human health**?
* Find a **local company/institution** that offers e-waste recycling services. Once you have such a place, look into what types of e-waste that company/institution can recycle and the steps they take during the recycling process.
* Find information regarding different ways to **reduce the negative impacts** of computers on the environment.
* How can **computers** be used in a positive way to **help the environment**?

## Create Visuals

Once you have all of your research, complete **all** of the following:

* Create a visual poster or diorama that uses **no words**, that describes negative effects of computers on **human health** (choose either mental health or physical health).  
* Create a visual poster or diorama that uses **no words** (other than the company name), that shows a **local company/institution** that offers e-waste recycling services, examples of items that can be recycled, and the steps in the recycling process.
* Create a mind map of your research relating to what measures can help **reduce the negative** effects of computers on the environment.
* Create a mind map of the **positive** effects of computers (and computer use) on the environment.

There are exemplars of visuals available for this assignment.

## Supplemental Text

In a word processing document, complete the following:

* For the human health poster: describe why you chose each particular image and how each of the images supports the narrative you are portraying. Provide specific justification.
* For the local company environmental poster: describe how each step in the recycling process works, and how each image you chose portrays that information.
* For the mind map of the reduction of negative effects, describe:
  * What **you** can do to lower the negative effects of computers on the environment. Be specific. Go beyond: turn off monitor, turn off power, recycle the parts, etc.
  * What **manufacturers** can do to lower the negative effects of computers on the environment. Be specific and justify your responses.
* For the mind map of the positive effects of computers on the environment: describe what overall conclusion(s) can you draw from the mind map/research? Explain and justify your response.

## Citations

* Cite your work using APA, MLA, or Chicago format (whichever one you want).
* Cite all images used from the internet. You can provide a list of hyperlinks to the images used.
  * If you used images from the tool of your choice, you do not have to cite those.

* 2 posters
* 2 mind maps
* 1 supplemental text document
