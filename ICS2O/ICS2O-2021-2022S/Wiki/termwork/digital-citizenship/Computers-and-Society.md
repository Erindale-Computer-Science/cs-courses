* How can someone protect themselves from the ethical and legal issues?

## Create an Infographic

Create an engaging infographic based on, **_at least_**, the research you completed above. 

If you have never created an infographic before, there are online tools available to help to make the process easier (i.e. Canva, Venngage, etc.). Another option is to complete this by hand, take a photo, and upload that photo.  

## Supplemental Text

In a word processing document, complete the following:

* Describe how your choice of infographic format best conveys the information researched.
* Provide your opinion on whether you believe the positives outweigh the negatives in regards to using the application you chose for the intended individuals. Justify your response with examples.
