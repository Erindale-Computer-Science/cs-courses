## &#x1F4D7; Task(s)

## Reference Previous Work

To complete this project you might need to reference your previous work from the following assignments:

* [Human Health and Environment](./Human-Health-and-Environment)
* [Post Secondary Opportunities](./Post-Secondary-Opportunities)
* [Computers and Society](./Computers-and-Society)

## Research

Complete research (or reference previous work) on a **different** assistive technology from the list in the [Computers and Society](./Computers-and-Society) project **that works on a mobile phone**, and collect information connected to the following prompts:

* Summarize how the assistive technology works.
* Who is the intended audience for the application you chose?
* What is the intended purpose of the application?
* What negative effects does this application have on human health?
* What ethical issues could come up from the creation of (or use of) this application?
* What legal issues could present themselves from the creation of (or use of) this application?

The assistive technology that you chose has to be one that is used on a mobile device. With this in mind, collect information connected to the following prompts related to mobile phone technology, in general:

* What positive effects can a mobile phone have on the environment? Justify your response.
* How do mobile phones positively affect our lives today? Justify your response.
* How might mobile phones negatively affect people's lives 50 years from now?

Mobile phone applications require people to create the applications. With this in mind, collect information connected to the following prompts related to those who work to create mobile phone applications:

* Choose a career in mobile phone application development.
* Describe the trends of this career at an **international** level (i.e. outside of Canada). In this particular case, choose a country _outside_ of North America to retrieve your information from. A reminder that trends in careers could include topics such as: whether the salary has been going up or down over the years, how the popularity of the career has changed over time, whether there are more or less jobs available over time, etc.
* Find a single college or university program _outside of North America_ related to the career and describe why someone would choose that international post-secondary institution over any other one in the world. A reminder that example topics to discuss could include: location, tuition, prestige, unique programs, etc.

## Product Creation

Once you have all of the research completed above, create an engaging infographic based on your research above, with the following criteria:

* Each point above needs to be summarized into, _**at most**_, 50 words per prompt (there are a total of 12 prompts above).
* Use of graphs, tables, and imagery should be used to help portray your meaning.

## Supplemental Text

In a word processing document, complete the following:

* Describe why you chose each particular image, graph, or table and how each of these support the narrative you are portraying. Provide specific justification.

* For each of the text blocks that you have in your infographic:

  * Describe what you would have liked to include in the infographic, but did not have space for. 

  * If you were able to fit everything you wanted to, what might you have included if you were provided with more space.

## Citations

  * Cite your work using APA, MLA, or Chicago format (whichever one you want).
  * Cite all images used from the internet. You can provide a list of hyperlinks to the images used.
    * If you used images from the tool of your choice, you do not have to cite those.

## Due Dates and Submission Details
