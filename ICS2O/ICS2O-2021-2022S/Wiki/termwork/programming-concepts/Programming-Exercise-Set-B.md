# &#x1F4D8; Exercise Set (B)

For all of these exercises, do **not** hand them in, just ensure your teacher sees the work to confirm you are on the right track.  It is highly suggested that you complete these exercises **prior** to attempting [Processing - Assignment 2](./Processing-Assignment-2)

## Exercise 7
* Recreate [this image](http://mrseidel.com/images/Processing/2O/Exercise6_2O.png) below.  Each set of shapes is created with ```for``` loops.  For example, there is only one ```triangle``` line of code, but the ```for``` loop draws multiple triangles.

## Exercise 8

* Recreate [this image](https://mrseidel.com/images/Processing/2O/Exercise8_2O.gif) below. Use ```while``` loops to complete this task.  You can technically complete this task using ```for``` loops, but it is expected that you practice using ```while``` loops.

## What's next?
If you have completed all of the exercises above, you can try the [challenges](./Programming-Challenges), or start writing your thoughts in the _Understanding Programming Concepts 2_ item available on replit while waiting to start on [Assignment 2](./Programming-Assignment-2).

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICS2O.jpg) for this is _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * _We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs._
  * _We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs._

You will be assessed on the following success criteria. This is a **verbal-feedback-only** section of the course.

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs_ | Look Fors                                                    |
