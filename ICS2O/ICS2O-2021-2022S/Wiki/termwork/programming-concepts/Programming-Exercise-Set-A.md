# &#x1F4D8; Exercise Set (A)

For all of these exercises, do **not** hand them in, just ensure your teacher sees the work to confirm you are on the right track. It is highly suggested that you complete these exercises **prior** to attempting [Assignment 1](./Programming-Assignment-1)

## Exercise 1
* Using your knowledge of Processing so far, recreate [this image](http://mrseidel.com/images/Processing/2O/Exercise1_2O.png). Use color, strokeWeight, strokeJoin, fill, etc. to **enhance** the picture

## Exercise 2
* Recreate [this sketch](http://mrseidel.com/images/Processing/2O/Exercise3_2O.gif). The circles should be created as you move your mouse.

## Exercise 3
* Recreate [this sketch](http://mrseidel.com/images/Processing/2O/Exercise3b_2O.gif). The circles should show up in a random space with a random colour.

## Exercise 4
* Recreate [this sketch](http://mrseidel.com/images/Processing/2O/Exercise4_2O.gif). You will need to use variables to complete this example.

## Exercise 5

* Recreate [this sketch](http://mrseidel.com/images/Processing/2O/Exercise5_2O.gif). You will need variables and if statements to complete this exercise.

## Exercise 6

* Recreate [this sketch](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1140787). This exercise requires the use of `key`, `keyCode`, `mouseIsPressed`, and `keyIsPressed`, as well as `if` statements and variables.

## What's next?

If you have completed all of the exercises above, you can try the [challenges](./Programming-Challenges), or start writing your thoughts in the _Understanding Programming Concepts 1_ item available on replit while waiting to start on [Assignment 1](./Programming-Assignment-1).

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICS2O.jpg) for this is _Programming Concepts_.
The specific learning goal(s) for this include:

  * _We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs._
  * _We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs._

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs_ | Look Fors                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I can describe the types of data that computers can process and store. | * variety of types of data understood, <br/>* can speak to, in detail, multiple types of data |
| I can use correct terminology to describe programming concepts (data types, constants, variables). | * accurate use of terminology,<br/>* can use proper terminology verbally and in writing,<br/>* clarity of communication |
| I can explain the difference between constants and variables used in programming. (B1) | * understanding of the purpose of constants,<br/>* understanding of the purpose of variables,<br/>* can compare the differences |
| I can describe the function of Boolean, comparison, order of operations and arithmetic operators. (B1) | * understanding of Boolean expressions,<br/>* understand the location and use of Boolean expressions,<br/>* can describe the order of operations if given a scenario,<br/>* understands the difference between `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`,<br/>* understands the difference between `=`, `==`, and `===`. |
| I can identify situations in which decision structures are required (if statements) | * location of `if` statements,<br/>* location of `else if`,<br/>* location of `else` |

| I can write a program that includes input (keyboard and mouse) and output (shown on screen) | * receive keyboard input, as necessary,<br/>* mouse input used, as necessary, |
| I can write a program that includes a decision structure for two or more choices (if statements) | * if statements are properly formatted,<br/>* if statement blocks include `else if` when appropriate,<br/>* if statements are separated into different blocks (instead of `else if`) when appropriate,<br/>* use of `else` statements, as necessary,<br/>* used appropriate operators (i.e. `||`, `&&`, `>`, etc.) |
| I can write clear and maintainable internal documentation to a specific set of standards (header, comments) | * clear, descriptive header,<br/>* header follows provided template,<br/>* comments exist above blocks of code,<br/>* comments are descriptive and easy to understand,<br/>* comments are appropriate to the block of code,<br/>* comments are _not_ on every line |
| I can write clear and maintainable code using proper programming standards (constant and variable names, indenting) | * variable names follow naming conventions,<br/>* variable naming convention chosen is consistently used throughout program,<br/>* variable names are descriptive to what they do,<br/>* constants following naming conventions,<br/>* indenting is completed per industry standards |
